    <h2>
      MOON-FACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      John Claverhouse was a moon-faced man. You know the kind, cheek-bones wide
      apart, chin and forehead melting into the cheeks to complete the perfect
      round, and the nose, broad and pudgy, equidistant from the circumference,
      flattened against the very centre of the face like a dough-ball upon the
      ceiling. Perhaps that is why I hated him, for truly he had become an
      offense to my eyes, and I believed the earth to be cumbered with his
      presence. Perhaps my mother may have been superstitious of the moon and
      looked upon it over the wrong shoulder at the wrong time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, I hated John Claverhouse. Not that he had done me what
      society would consider a wrong or an ill turn. Far from it. The evil was
      of a deeper, subtler sort; so elusive, so intangible, as to defy clear,
      definite analysis in words. We all experience such things at some period
      in our lives. For the first time we see a certain individual, one who the
      very instant before we did not dream existed; and yet, at the first moment
      of meeting, we say: &ldquo;I do not like that man.&rdquo; Why do we not like him? Ah,
      we do not know why; we know only that we do not. We have taken a dislike,
      that is all. And so I with John Claverhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      What right had such a man to be happy? Yet he was an optimist. He was
      always gleeful and laughing. All things were always all right, curse him!
      Ah I how it grated on my soul that he should be so happy! Other men could
      laugh, and it did not bother me. I even used to laugh myself&mdash;before
      I met John Claverhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his laugh! It irritated me, maddened me, as nothing else under the sun
      could irritate or madden me. It haunted me, gripped hold of me, and would
      not let me go. It was a huge, Gargantuan laugh. Waking or sleeping it was
      always with me, whirring and jarring across my heart-strings like an
      enormous rasp. At break of day it came whooping across the fields to spoil
      my pleasant morning revery. Under the aching noonday glare, when the green
      things drooped and the birds withdrew to the depths of the forest, and all
      nature drowsed, his great &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; rose up to the sky and
      challenged the sun. And at black midnight, from the lonely cross-roads
      where he turned from town into his own place, came his plaguey
      cachinnations to rouse me from my sleep and make me writhe and clench my
      nails into my palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went forth privily in the night-time, and turned his cattle into his
      fields, and in the morning heard his whooping laugh as he drove them out
      again. &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the poor, dumb beasties are not to be
      blamed for straying into fatter pastures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a dog he called &ldquo;Mars,&rdquo; a big, splendid brute, part deer-hound and
      part blood-hound, and resembling both. Mars was a great delight to him,
      and they were always together. But I bided my time, and one day, when
      opportunity was ripe, lured the animal away and settled for him with
      strychnine and beefsteak. It made positively no impression on John
      Claverhouse. His laugh was as hearty and frequent as ever, and his face as
      much like the full moon as it always had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I set fire to his haystacks and his barn. But the next morning, being
      Sunday, he went forth blithe and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; I asked him, as he went by the cross-roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trout,&rdquo; he said, and his face beamed like a full moon. &ldquo;I just dote on
      trout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever such an impossible man! His whole harvest had gone up in
      his haystacks and barn. It was uninsured, I knew. And yet, in the face of
      famine and the rigorous winter, he went out gayly in quest of a mess of
      trout, forsooth, because he &ldquo;doted&rdquo; on them! Had gloom but rested, no
      matter how lightly, on his brow, or had his bovine countenance grown long
      and serious and less like the moon, or had he removed that smile but once
      from off his face, I am sure I could have forgiven him for existing. But
      no, he grew only more cheerful under misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      I insulted him. He looked at me in slow and smiling surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fight you? Why?&rdquo; he asked slowly. And then he laughed. &ldquo;You are so
      funny! Ho! ho! You&rsquo;ll be the death of me! He! he! he! Oh! Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What would you? It was past endurance. By the blood of Judas, how I hated
      him! Then there was that name&mdash;Claverhouse! What a name! Wasn&rsquo;t it
      absurd? Claverhouse! Merciful heaven, WHY Claverhouse? Again and again I
      asked myself that question. I should not have minded Smith, or Brown, or
      Jones&mdash;but CLAVERHOUSE! I leave it to you. Repeat it to yourself&mdash;Claverhouse.
      Just listen to the ridiculous sound of it&mdash;Claverhouse! Should a man
      live with such a name? I ask of you. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; you say. And &ldquo;No&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I bethought me of his mortgage. What of his crops and barn destroyed,
      I knew he would be unable to meet it. So I got a shrewd, close-mouthed,
      tight-fisted money-lender to get the mortgage transferred to him. I did
      not appear but through this agent I forced the foreclosure, and but few
      days (no more, believe me, than the law allowed) were given John
      Claverhouse to remove his goods and chattels from the premises. Then I
      strolled down to see how he took it, for he had lived there upward of
      twenty years. But he met me with his saucer-eyes twinkling, and the light
      glowing and spreading in his face till it was as a full-risen moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;The funniest tike, that youngster of mine! Did
      you ever hear the like? Let me tell you. He was down playing by the edge
      of the river when a piece of the bank caved in and splashed him. &lsquo;O papa!&rsquo; 
      he cried; &lsquo;a great big puddle flewed up and hit me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and waited for me to join him in his infernal glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any laugh in it,&rdquo; I said shortly, and I know my face went
      sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded me with wonderment, and then came the damnable light, glowing
      and spreading, as I have described it, till his face shone soft and warm,
      like the summer moon, and then the laugh&mdash;&ldquo;Ha! ha! That&rsquo;s funny! You
      don&rsquo;t see it, eh? He! he! Ho! ho! ho! He doesn&rsquo;t see it! Why, look here.
      You know a puddle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I turned on my heel and left him. That was the last. I could stand it
      no longer. The thing must end right there, I thought, curse him! The earth
      should be quit of him. And as I went over the hill, I could hear his
      monstrous laugh reverberating against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I pride myself on doing things neatly, and when I resolved to kill
      John Claverhouse I had it in mind to do so in such fashion that I should
      not look back upon it and feel ashamed. I hate bungling, and I hate
      brutality. To me there is something repugnant in merely striking a man
      with one&rsquo;s naked fist&mdash;faugh! it is sickening! So, to shoot, or stab,
      or club John Claverhouse (oh, that name!) did not appeal to me. And not
      only was I impelled to do it neatly and artistically, but also in such
      manner that not the slightest possible suspicion could be directed against
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end I bent my intellect, and, after a week of profound incubation,
      I hatched the scheme. Then I set to work. I bought a water spaniel bitch,
      five months old, and devoted my whole attention to her training. Had any
      one spied upon me, they would have remarked that this training consisted
      entirely of one thing&mdash;RETRIEVING. I taught the dog, which I called
      &ldquo;Bellona,&rdquo; to fetch sticks I threw into the water, and not only to fetch,
      but to fetch at once, without mouthing or playing with them. The point was
      that she was to stop for nothing, but to deliver the stick in all haste. I
      made a practice of running away and leaving her to chase me, with the
      stick in her mouth, till she caught me. She was a bright animal, and took
      to the game with such eagerness that I was soon content.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, at the first casual opportunity, I presented Bellona to John
      Claverhouse. I knew what I was about, for I was aware of a little weakness
      of his, and of a little private sinning of which he was regularly and
      inveterately guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, when I placed the end of the rope in his hand. &ldquo;No, you
      don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo; And his mouth opened wide and he grinned all over his
      damnable moon-face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I kind of thought, somehow, you didn&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; he explained.
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it funny for me to make such a mistake?&rdquo; And at the thought he
      held his sides with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo; he managed to ask between paroxysms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bellona,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; he tittered. &ldquo;What a funny name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gritted my teeth, for his mirth put them on edge, and snapped out
      between them, &ldquo;She was the wife of Mars, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the light of the full moon began to suffuse his face, until he
      exploded with: &ldquo;That was my other dog. Well, I guess she&rsquo;s a widow now.
      Oh! Ho! ho! E! he! he! Ho!&rdquo; he whooped after me, and I turned and fled
      swiftly over the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week passed by, and on Saturday evening I said to him, &ldquo;You go away
      Monday, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded his head and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t have another chance to get a mess of those trout you just
      &lsquo;dote&rsquo; on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not notice the sneer. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      going up to-morrow to try pretty hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus was assurance made doubly sure, and I went back to my house hugging
      myself with rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning I saw him go by with a dip-net and gunnysack, and
      Bellona trotting at his heels. I knew where he was bound, and cut out by
      the back pasture and climbed through the underbrush to the top of the
      mountain. Keeping carefully out of sight, I followed the crest along for a
      couple of miles to a natural amphitheatre in the hills, where the little
      river raced down out of a gorge and stopped for breath in a large and
      placid rock-bound pool. That was the spot! I sat down on the croup of the
      mountain, where I could see all that occurred, and lighted my pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere many minutes had passed, John Claverhouse came plodding up the bed of
      the stream. Bellona was ambling about him, and they were in high feather,
      her short, snappy barks mingling with his deeper chest-notes. Arrived at
      the pool, he threw down the dip-net and sack, and drew from his hip-pocket
      what looked like a large, fat candle. But I knew it to be a stick of
      &ldquo;giant&rdquo;; for such was his method of catching trout. He dynamited them. He
      attached the fuse by wrapping the &ldquo;giant&rdquo; tightly in a piece of cotton.
      Then he ignited the fuse and tossed the explosive into the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a flash, Bellona was into the pool after it. I could have shrieked
      aloud for joy. Claverhouse yelled at her, but without avail. He pelted her
      with clods and rocks, but she swam steadily on till she got the stick of
      &ldquo;giant&rdquo; in her mouth, when she whirled about and headed for shore. Then,
      for the first time, he realized his danger, and started to run. As
      foreseen and planned by me, she made the bank and took out after him. Oh,
      I tell you, it was great! As I have said, the pool lay in a sort of
      amphitheatre. Above and below, the stream could be crossed on
      stepping-stones. And around and around, up and down and across the stones,
      raced Claverhouse and Bellona. I could never have believed that such an
      ungainly man could run so fast. But run he did, Bellona hot-footed after
      him, and gaining. And then, just as she caught up, he in full stride, and
      she leaping with nose at his knee, there was a sudden flash, a burst of
      smoke, a terrific detonation, and where man and dog had been the instant
      before there was naught to be seen but a big hole in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death from accident while engaged in illegal fishing.&rdquo; That was the
      verdict of the coroner&rsquo;s jury; and that is why I pride myself on the neat
      and artistic way in which I finished off John Claverhouse. There was no
      bungling, no brutality; nothing of which to be ashamed in the whole
      transaction, as I am sure you will agree. No more does his infernal laugh
      go echoing among the hills, and no more does his fat moon-face rise up to
      vex me. My days are peaceful now, and my night&rsquo;s sleep deep.

    <h2>
      THE LEOPARD MAN&rsquo;S STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had a dreamy, far-away look in his eyes, and his sad, insistent voice,
      gentle-spoken as a maid&rsquo;s, seemed the placid embodiment of some
      deep-seated melancholy. He was the Leopard Man, but he did not look it.
      His business in life, whereby he lived, was to appear in a cage of
      performing leopards before vast audiences, and to thrill those audiences
      by certain exhibitions of nerve for which his employers rewarded him on a
      scale commensurate with the thrills he produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I say, he did not look it. He was narrow-hipped, narrow-shouldered, and
      anaemic, while he seemed not so much oppressed by gloom as by a sweet and
      gentle sadness, the weight of which was as sweetly and gently borne. For
      an hour I had been trying to get a story out of him, but he appeared to
      lack imagination. To him there was no romance in his gorgeous career, no
      deeds of daring, no thrills&mdash;nothing but a gray sameness and infinite
      boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lions? Oh, yes! he had fought with them. It was nothing. All you had to do
      was to stay sober. Anybody could whip a lion to a standstill with an
      ordinary stick. He had fought one for half an hour once. Just hit him on
      the nose every time he rushed, and when he got artful and rushed with his
      head down, why, the thing to do was to stick out your leg. When he grabbed
      at the leg you drew it back and hit hint on the nose again. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the far-away look in his eyes and his soft flow of words he showed me
      his scars. There were many of them, and one recent one where a tigress had
      reached for his shoulder and gone down to the bone. I could see the neatly
      mended rents in the coat he had on. His right arm, from the elbow down,
      looked as though it had gone through a threshing machine, what of the
      ravage wrought by claws and fangs. But it was nothing, he said, only the
      old wounds bothered him somewhat when rainy weather came on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his face brightened with a recollection, for he was really as
      anxious to give me a story as I was to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard of the lion-tamer who was hated by another man?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked pensively at a sick lion in the cage opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the toothache,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Well, the lion-tamer&rsquo;s big play to the
      audience was putting his head in a lion&rsquo;s mouth. The man who hated him
      attended every performance in the hope sometime of seeing that lion crunch
      down. He followed the show about all over the country. The years went by
      and he grew old, and the lion-tamer grew old, and the lion grew old. And
      at last one day, sitting in a front seat, he saw what he had waited for.
      The lion crunched down, and there wasn&rsquo;t any need to call a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Leopard Man glanced casually over his finger nails in a manner which
      would have been critical had it not been so sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s what I call patience,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s my style. But
      it was not the style of a fellow I knew. He was a little, thin, sawed-off,
      sword-swallowing and juggling Frenchman. De Ville, he called himself, and
      he had a nice wife. She did trapeze work and used to dive from under the
      roof into a net, turning over once on the way as nice as you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Ville had a quick temper, as quick as his hand, and his hand was as
      quick as the paw of a tiger. One day, because the ring-master called him a
      frog-eater, or something like that and maybe a little worse, he shoved him
      against the soft pine background he used in his knife-throwing act, so
      quick the ring-master didn&rsquo;t have time to think, and there, before the
      audience, De Ville kept the air on fire with his knives, sinking them into
      the wood all around the ring-master so close that they passed through his
      clothes and most of them bit into his skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clowns had to pull the knives out to get him loose, for he was pinned
      fast. So the word went around to watch out for De Ville, and no one dared
      be more than barely civil to his wife. And she was a sly bit of baggage,
      too, only all hands were afraid of De Ville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was one man, Wallace, who was afraid of nothing. He was the
      lion-tamer, and he had the self-same trick of putting his head into the
      lion&rsquo;s mouth. He&rsquo;d put it into the mouths of any of them, though he
      preferred Augustus, a big, good-natured beast who could always be depended
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying, Wallace&mdash;&lsquo;King&rsquo; Wallace we called him&mdash;was
      afraid of nothing alive or dead. He was a king and no mistake. I&rsquo;ve seen
      him drunk, and on a wager go into the cage of a lion that&rsquo;d turned nasty,
      and without a stick beat him to a finish. Just did it with his fist on the
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Ville&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At an uproar behind us the Leopard Man turned quietly around. It was a
      divided cage, and a monkey, poking through the bars and around the
      partition, had had its paw seized by a big gray wolf who was trying to
      pull it off by main strength. The arm seemed stretching out longer end
      longer like a thick elastic, and the unfortunate monkey&rsquo;s mates were
      raising a terrible din. No keeper was at hand, so the Leopard Man stepped
      over a couple of paces, dealt the wolf a sharp blow on the nose with the
      light cane he carried, and returned with a sadly apologetic smile to take
      up his unfinished sentence as though there had been no interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;looked at King Wallace and King Wallace looked at her, while De
      Ville looked black. We warned Wallace, but it was no use. He laughed at
      us, as he laughed at De Ville one day when he shoved De Ville&rsquo;s head into
      a bucket of paste because he wanted to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De Ville was in a pretty mess&mdash;I helped to scrape him off; but he
      was cool as a cucumber and made no threats at all. But I saw a glitter in
      his eyes which I had seen often in the eyes of wild beasts, and I went out
      of my way to give Wallace a final warning. He laughed, but he did not look
      so much in Madame de Ville&rsquo;s direction after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several months passed by. Nothing had happened and I was beginning to
      think it all a scare over nothing. We were West by that time, showing in
      &lsquo;Frisco. It was during the afternoon performance, and the big tent was
      filled with women and children, when I went looking for Red Denny, the
      head canvas-man, who had walked off with my pocket-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passing by one of the dressing tents I glanced in through a hole in the
      canvas to see if I could locate him. He wasn&rsquo;t there, but directly in
      front of me was King Wallace, in tights, waiting for his turn to go on
      with his cage of performing lions. He was watching with much amusement a
      quarrel between a couple of trapeze artists. All the rest of the people in
      the dressing tent were watching the same thing, with the exception of De
      Ville whom I noticed staring at Wallace with undisguised hatred. Wallace
      and the rest were all too busy following the quarrel to notice this or
      what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I saw it through the hole in the canvas. De Ville drew his
      handkerchief from his pocket, made as though to mop the sweat from his
      face with it (it was a hot day), and at the same time walked past
      Wallace&rsquo;s back. The look troubled me at the time, for not only did I see
      hatred in it, but I saw triumph as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;De Ville will bear watching,&rsquo; I said to myself, and I really breathed
      easier when I saw him go out the entrance to the circus grounds and board
      an electric car for down town. A few minutes later I was in the big tent,
      where I had overhauled Red Denny. King Wallace was doing his turn and
      holding the audience spellbound. He was in a particularly vicious mood,
      and he kept the lions stirred up till they were all snarling, that is, all
      of them except old Augustus, and he was just too fat and lazy and old to
      get stirred up over anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally Wallace cracked the old lion&rsquo;s knees with his whip and got him
      into position. Old Augustus, blinking good-naturedly, opened his mouth and
      in popped Wallace&rsquo;s head. Then the jaws came together, CRUNCH, just like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Leopard Man smiled in a sweetly wistful fashion, and the far-away look
      came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was the end of King Wallace,&rdquo; he went on in his sad, low voice.
      &ldquo;After the excitement cooled down I watched my chance and bent over and
      smelled Wallace&rsquo;s head. Then I sneezed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It... it was...?&rdquo; I queried with halting eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snuff&mdash;that De Ville dropped on his hair in the dressing tent. Old
      Augustus never meant to do it. He only sneezed.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see why you should not turn this immense amount of unusual
      information to account,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Unlike most men equipped with
      similar knowledge, YOU have expression. Your style is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is sufficiently&mdash;er&mdash;journalese?&rdquo; he interrupted suavely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! You could turn a pretty penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he interlocked his fingers meditatively, shrugged his shoulders, and
      dismissed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried it. It does not pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was paid for and published,&rdquo; he added, after a pause. &ldquo;And I was also
      honored with sixty days in the Hobo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hobo?&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hobo&mdash;&rdquo; He fixed his eyes on my Spencer and ran along the titles
      while he cast his definition. &ldquo;The Hobo, my dear fellow, is the name for
      that particular place of detention in city and county jails wherein are
      assembled tramps, drunks, beggars, and the riff-raff of petty offenders.
      The word itself is a pretty one, and it has a history. Hautbois&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      the French of it. Haut, meaning high, and bois, wood. In English it
      becomes hautboy, a wooden musical instrument of two-foot tone, I believe,
      played with a double reed, an oboe, in fact. You remember in &lsquo;Henry IV&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;&lsquo;The case of a treble hautboy
     Was a mansion for him, a court.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From this to ho-boy is but a step, and for that matter the English used
      the terms interchangeably. But&mdash;and mark you, the leap paralyzes one&mdash;crossing
      the Western Ocean, in New York City, hautboy, or ho-boy, becomes the name
      by which the night-scavenger is known. In a way one understands its being
      born of the contempt for wandering players and musical fellows. But see
      the beauty of it! the burn and the brand! The night-scavenger, the pariah,
      the miserable, the despised, the man without caste! And in its next
      incarnation, consistently and logically, it attaches itself to the
      American outcast, namely, the tramp. Then, as others have mutilated its
      sense, the tramp mutilates its form, and ho-boy becomes exultantly hobo.
      Wherefore, the large stone and brick cells, lined with double and
      triple-tiered bunks, in which the Law is wont to incarcerate him, he calls
      the Hobo. Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I sat back and marvelled secretly at this encyclopaedic-minded man,
      this Leith Clay-Randolph, this common tramp who made himself at home in my
      den, charmed such friends as gathered at my small table, outshone me with
      his brilliance and his manners, spent my spending money, smoked my best
      cigars, and selected from my ties and studs with a cultivated and
      discriminating eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He absently walked over to the shelves and looked into Loria&rsquo;s &ldquo;Economic
      Foundation of Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to talk with you,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You are not indifferently
      schooled. You&rsquo;ve read the books, and your economic interpretation of
      history, as you choose to call it&rdquo; (this with a sneer), &ldquo;eminently fits
      you for an intellectual outlook on life. But your sociologic judgments are
      vitiated by your lack of practical knowledge. Now I, who know the books,
      pardon me, somewhat better than you, know life, too. I have lived it,
      naked, taken it up in both my hands and looked at it, and tasted it, the
      flesh and the blood of it, and, being purely an intellectual, I have been
      biased by neither passion nor prejudice. All of which is necessary for
      clear concepts, and all of which you lack. Ah! a really clever passage.
      Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he read aloud to me in his remarkable style, paralleling the text with
      a running criticism and commentary, lucidly wording involved and lumbering
      periods, casting side and cross lights upon the subject, introducing
      points the author had blundered past and objections he had ignored,
      catching up lost ends, flinging a contrast into a paradox and reducing it
      to a coherent and succinctly stated truth&mdash;in short, flashing his
      luminous genius in a blaze of fire over pages erstwhile dull and heavy and
      lifeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is long since that Leith Clay-Randolph (note the hyphenated surname)
      knocked at the back door of Idlewild and melted the heart of Gunda. Now
      Gunda was cold as her Norway hills, though in her least frigid moods she
      was capable of permitting especially nice-looking tramps to sit on the
      back stoop and devour lone crusts and forlorn and forsaken chops. But that
      a tatterdemalion out of the night should invade the sanctity of her
      kitchen-kingdom and delay dinner while she set a place for him in the
      warmest corner, was a matter of such moment that the Sunflower went to
      see. Ah, the Sunflower, of the soft heart and swift sympathy! Leith
      Clay-Randolph threw his glamour over her for fifteen long minutes, whilst
      I brooded with my cigar, and then she fluttered back with vague words and
      the suggestion of a cast-off suit I would never miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I shall never miss it,&rdquo; I said, and I had in mind the dark gray
      suit with the pockets draggled from the freightage of many books&mdash;books
      that had spoiled more than one day&rsquo;s fishing sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you, however,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;to mend the pockets first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Sunflower&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;N&mdash;o,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the black one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black one!&rdquo; This explosively, incredulously. &ldquo;I wear it quite often.
      I&mdash;I intended wearing it to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have two better ones, and you know I never liked it, dear,&rdquo; the
      Sunflower hurried on. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s shiny&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it soon will be, which is just the same, and the man is really
      estimable. He is nice and refined, and I am sure he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has seen better days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the weather is raw and beastly, and his clothes are threadbare.
      And you have many suits&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five,&rdquo; I corrected, &ldquo;counting in the dark gray fishing outfit with the
      draggled pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has none, no home, nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even a Sunflower,&rdquo;&mdash;putting my arm around her,&mdash;&ldquo;wherefore
      he is deserving of all things. Give him the black suit, dear&mdash;nay,
      the best one, the very best one. Under high heaven for such lack there
      must be compensation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE a dear!&rdquo; And the Sunflower moved to the door and looked back
      alluringly. &ldquo;You are a PERFECT dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this after seven years, I marvelled, till she was back again, timid
      and apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I gave him one of your white shirts. He wore a cheap horrid
      cotton thing, and I knew it would look ridiculous. And then his shoes were
      so slipshod, I let him have a pair of yours, the old ones with the narrow
      caps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they pinched horribly, and you know they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was ever thus the Sunflower vindicated things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Leith Clay-Randolph came to Idlewild to stay, how long I did not
      dream. Nor did I dream how often he was to come, for he was like an
      erratic comet. Fresh he would arrive, and cleanly clad, from grand folk
      who were his friends as I was his friend, and again, weary and worn, he
      would creep up the brier-rose path from the Montanas or Mexico. And
      without a word, when his wanderlust gripped him, he was off and away into
      that great mysterious underworld he called &ldquo;The Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not bring myself to leave until I had thanked you, you of the
      open hand and heart,&rdquo; he said, on the night he donned my good black suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I confess I was startled when I glanced over the top of my paper and
      saw a lofty-browed and eminently respectable-looking gentleman, boldly and
      carelessly at ease. The Sunflower was right. He must have known better
      days for the black suit and white shirt to have effected such a
      transformation. Involuntarily I rose to my feet, prompted to meet him on
      equal ground. And then it was that the Clay-Randolph glamour descended
      upon me. He slept at Idlewild that night, and the next night, and for many
      nights. And he was a man to love. The Son of Anak, otherwise Rufus the
      Blue-Eyed, and also plebeianly known as Tots, rioted with him from
      brier-rose path to farthest orchard, scalped him in the haymow with
      barbaric yells, and once, with pharisaic zeal, was near to crucifying him
      under the attic roof beams. The Sunflower would have loved him for the Son
      of Anak&rsquo;s sake, had she not loved him for his own. As for myself, let the
      Sunflower tell, in the times he elected to be gone, of how often I
      wondered when Leith would come back again, Leith the Lovable. Yet he was a
      man of whom we knew nothing. Beyond the fact that he was Kentucky-born,
      his past was a blank. He never spoke of it. And he was a man who prided
      himself upon his utter divorce of reason from emotion. To him the world
      spelled itself out in problems. I charged him once with being guilty of
      emotion when roaring round the den with the Son of Anak pickaback. Not so,
      he held. Could he not cuddle a sense-delight for the problem&rsquo;s sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was elusive. A man who intermingled nameless argot with polysyllabic
      and technical terms, he would seem sometimes the veriest criminal, in
      speech, face, expression, everything; at other times the cultured and
      polished gentleman, and again, the philosopher and scientist. But there
      was something glimmering; there which I never caught&mdash;flashes of
      sincerity, of real feeling, I imagined, which were sped ere I could grasp;
      echoes of the man he once was, possibly, or hints of the man behind the
      mask. But the mask he never lifted, and the real man we never knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the sixty days with which you were rewarded for your journalism?&rdquo; I
      asked. &ldquo;Never mind Loria. Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I must.&rdquo; He flung one knee over the other with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a town that shall be nameless,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;in fact, a city of fifty
      thousand, a fair and beautiful city wherein men slave for dollars and
      women for dress, an idea came to me. My front was prepossessing, as fronts
      go, and my pockets empty. I had in recollection a thought I once
      entertained of writing a reconciliation of Kant and Spencer. Not that they
      are reconcilable, of course, but the room offered for scientific satire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waved my hand impatiently, and he broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just tracing my mental states for you, in order to show the genesis
      of the action,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;However, the idea came. What was the matter
      with a tramp sketch for the daily press? The Irreconcilability of the
      Constable and the Tramp, for instance? So I hit the drag (the drag, my
      dear fellow, is merely the street), or the high places, if you will, for a
      newspaper office. The elevator whisked me into the sky, and Cerberus, in
      the guise of an anaemic office boy, guarded the door. Consumption, one
      could see it at a glance; nerve, Irish, colossal; tenacity, undoubted;
      dead inside the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pale youth,&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;I pray thee the way to the sanctum-sanctorum, to
      the Most High Cock-a-lorum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He deigned to look at me, scornfully, with infinite weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;G&rsquo;wan an&rsquo; see the janitor. I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about the gas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, my lily-white, the editor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wich editor?&rsquo; he snapped like a young bullterrier. &lsquo;Dramatic? Sportin&rsquo;?
      Society? Sunday? Weekly? Daily? Telegraph? Local? News? Editorial? Wich?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, I did not know. &lsquo;THE Editor,&rsquo; I proclaimed stoutly. &lsquo;The ONLY
      Editor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aw, Spargo!&rsquo; he sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Of course, Spargo,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Who else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gimme yer card,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yer card&mdash;Say! Wot&rsquo;s yer business, anyway?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the anaemic Cerberus sized me up with so insolent an eye that I
      reached over and took him out of his chair. I knocked on his meagre chest
      with my fore knuckle, and fetched forth a weak, gaspy cough; but he looked
      at me unflinchingly, much like a defiant sparrow held in the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am the census-taker Time,&rsquo; I boomed in sepulchral tones. &lsquo;Beware lest
      I knock too loud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereupon I rapped him smartly, and he choked and turned purplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, whatcher want?&rsquo; he wheezed with returning breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want Spargo, the only Spargo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then leave go, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll glide an&rsquo; see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No you don&rsquo;t, my lily-white.&rsquo; And I took a tighter grip on his collar.
      &lsquo;No bouncers in mine, understand! I&rsquo;ll go along.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leith dreamily surveyed the long ash of his cigar and turned to me. &ldquo;Do
      you know, Anak, you can&rsquo;t appreciate the joy of being the buffoon, playing
      the clown. You couldn&rsquo;t do it if you wished. Your pitiful little
      conventions and smug assumptions of decency would prevent. But simply to
      turn loose your soul to every whimsicality, to play the fool unafraid of
      any possible result, why, that requires a man other than a householder and
      law-respecting citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, as I was saying, I saw the only Spargo. He was a big, beefy,
      red-faced personage, full-jowled and double-chinned, sweating at his desk
      in his shirt-sleeves. It was August, you know. He was talking into a
      telephone when I entered, or swearing rather, I should say, and the while
      studying me with his eyes. When he hung up, he turned to me expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are a very busy man,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He jerked a nod with his head, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And after all, is it worth it?&rsquo; I went on. &lsquo;What does life mean that it
      should make you sweat? What justification do you find in sweat? Now look
      at me. I toil not, neither do I spin&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you? What are you?&rsquo; he bellowed with a suddenness that was,
      well, rude, tearing the words out as a dog does a bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A very pertinent question, sir,&rsquo; I acknowledged. &lsquo;First, I am a man;
      next, a down-trodden American citizen. I am cursed with neither
      profession, trade, nor expectations. Like Esau, I am pottageless. My
      residence is everywhere; the sky is my coverlet. I am one of the
      dispossessed, a sansculotte, a proletarian, or, in simpler phraseology
      addressed to your understanding, a tramp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What the hell&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, fair sir, a tramp, a man of devious ways and strange lodgements and
      multifarious&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Quit it!&rsquo; he shouted. &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He started and half reached for an open drawer where must have reposed a
      revolver, then bethought himself and growled, &lsquo;This is no bank.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nor have I checks to cash. But I have, sir, an idea, which, by your
      leave and kind assistance, I shall transmute into cash. In short, how does
      a tramp sketch, done by a tramp to the life, strike you? Are you open to
      it? Do your readers hunger for it? Do they crave after it? Can they be
      happy without it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought for a moment that he would have apoplexy, but he quelled the
      unruly blood and said he liked my nerve. I thanked him and assured him I
      liked it myself. Then he offered me a cigar and said he thought he&rsquo;d do
      business with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But mind you,&rsquo; he said, when he had jabbed a bunch of copy paper into my
      hand and given me a pencil from his vest pocket, &lsquo;mind you, I won&rsquo;t stand
      for the high and flighty philosophical, and I perceive you have a tendency
      that way. Throw in the local color, wads of it, and a bit of sentiment
      perhaps, but no slumgullion about political economy nor social strata or
      such stuff. Make it concrete, to the point, with snap and go and life,
      crisp and crackling and interesting&mdash;tumble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tumbled and borrowed a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the local color!&rsquo; he shouted after me through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Anak, it was the local color that did for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The anaemic Cerberus grinned when I took the elevator. &lsquo;Got the bounce,
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, pale youth, so lily-white,&rsquo; I chortled, waving the copy paper; &lsquo;not
      the bounce, but a detail. I&rsquo;ll be City Editor in three months, and then
      I&rsquo;ll make you jump.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as the elevator stopped at the next floor down to take on a pair of
      maids, he strolled over to the shaft, and without frills or verbiage
      consigned me and my detail to perdition. But I liked him. He had pluck and
      was unafraid, and he knew, as well as I, that death clutched him close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could you, Leith,&rdquo; I cried, the picture of the consumptive lad
      strong before me, &ldquo;how could you treat him so barbarously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leith laughed dryly. &ldquo;My dear fellow, how often must I explain to you your
      confusions? Orthodox sentiment and stereotyped emotion master you. And
      then your temperament! You are really incapable of rational judgments.
      Cerberus? Pshaw! A flash expiring, a mote of fading sparkle, a dim-pulsing
      and dying organism&mdash;pouf! a snap of the fingers, a puff of breath,
      what would you? A pawn in the game of life. Not even a problem. There is
      no problem in a stillborn babe, nor in a dead child. They never arrived.
      Nor did Cerberus. Now for a really pretty problem&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the local color?&rdquo; I prodded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Keep me in the running. Well, I took my
      handful of copy paper down to the railroad yards (for local color),
      dangled my legs from a side-door Pullman, which is another name for a
      box-car, and ran off the stuff. Of course I made it clever and brilliant
      and all that, with my little unanswerable slings at the state and my
      social paradoxes, and withal made it concrete enough to dissatisfy the
      average citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the tramp standpoint, the constabulary of the township was
      particularly rotten, and I proceeded to open the eyes of the good people.
      It is a proposition, mathematically demonstrable, that it costs the
      community more to arrest, convict, and confine its tramps in jail, than to
      send them as guests, for like periods of time, to the best hotel. And this
      I developed, giving the facts and figures, the constable fees and the
      mileage, and the court and jail expenses. Oh, it was convincing, and it
      was true; and I did it in a lightly humorous fashion which fetched the
      laugh and left the sting. The main objection to the system, I contended,
      was the defraudment and robbery of the tramp. The good money which the
      community paid out for him should enable him to riot in luxury instead of
      rotting in dungeons. I even drew the figures so fine as to permit him not
      only to live in the best hotel but to smoke two twenty-five-cent cigars
      and indulge in a ten-cent shine each day, and still not cost the taxpayers
      so much as they were accustomed to pay for his conviction and jail
      entertainment. And, as subsequent events proved, it made the taxpayers
      wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the constables I drew to the life; nor did I forget a certain Sol
      Glenhart, as rotten a police judge as was to be found between the seas.
      And this I say out of a vast experience. While he was notorious in local
      trampdom, his civic sins were not only not unknown but a crying reproach
      to the townspeople. Of course I refrained from mentioning name or habitat,
      drawing the picture in an impersonal, composite sort of way, which none
      the less blinded no one to the faithfulness of the local color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, myself a tramp, the tenor of the article was a protest against
      the maltreatment of the tramp. Cutting the taxpayers to the pits of their
      purses threw them open to sentiment, and then in I tossed the sentiment,
      lumps and chunks of it. Trust me, it was excellently done, and the
      rhetoric&mdash;say! Just listen to the tail of my peroration:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So, as we go mooching along the drag, with a sharp lamp out for John
      Law, we cannot help remembering that we are beyond the pale; that our ways
      are not their ways; and that the ways of John Law with us are different
      from his ways with other men. Poor lost souls, wailing for a crust in the
      dark, we know full well our helplessness and ignominy. And well may we
      repeat after a stricken brother over-seas: &ldquo;Our pride it is to know no
      spur of pride.&rdquo; Man has forgotten us; God has forgotten us; only are we
      remembered by the harpies of justice, who prey upon our distress and coin
      our sighs and tears into bright shining dollars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incidentally, my picture of Sol Glenhart, the police judge, was good. A
      striking likeness, and unmistakable, with phrases tripping along like
      this: &lsquo;This crook-nosed, gross-bodied harpy&rsquo;; &lsquo;this civic sinner, this
      judicial highwayman&rsquo;; &lsquo;possessing the morals of the Tenderloin and an
      honor which thieves&rsquo; honor puts to shame&rsquo;; &lsquo;who compounds criminality with
      shyster-sharks, and in atonement railroads the unfortunate and impecunious
      to rotting cells,&rsquo;&mdash;and so forth and so forth, style sophomoric and
      devoid of the dignity and tone one would employ in a dissertation on
      &lsquo;Surplus Value,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Fallacies of Marxism,&rsquo; but just the stuff the
      dear public likes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; grunted Spargo when I put the copy in his fist. &lsquo;Swift gait you
      strike, my man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fixed a hypnotic eye on his vest pocket, and he passed out one of his
      superior cigars, which I burned while he ran through the stuff. Twice or
      thrice he looked over the top of the paper at me, searchingly, but said
      nothing till he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;d you work, you pencil-pusher?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My maiden effort,&rsquo; I simpered modestly, scraping one foot and faintly
      simulating embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Maiden hell! What salary do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;No salary in mine, thank you most to death. I am
      a free down-trodden American citizen, and no man shall say my time is
      his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Save John Law,&rsquo; he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Save John Law,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How did you know I was bucking the police department?&rsquo; he demanded
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, but I knew you were in training,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Yesterday
      morning a charitably inclined female presented me with three biscuits, a
      piece of cheese, and a funereal slab of chocolate cake, all wrapped in the
      current Clarion, wherein I noted an unholy glee because the Cowbell&rsquo;s
      candidate for chief of police had been turned down. Likewise I learned the
      municipal election was at hand, and put two and two together. Another
      mayor, and the right kind, means new police commissioners; new police
      commissioners means new chief of police; new chief of police means
      Cowbell&rsquo;s candidate; ergo, your turn to play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stood up, shook my hand, and emptied his plethoric vest pocket. I put
      them away and puffed on the old one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; he jubilated. &lsquo;This stuff&rsquo; (patting my copy) &lsquo;is the first
      gun of the campaign. You&rsquo;ll touch off many another before we&rsquo;re done. I&rsquo;ve
      been looking for you for years. Come on in on the editorial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, now!&rsquo; he admonished sharply. &lsquo;No shenanagan! The Cowbell must have
      you. It hungers for you, craves after you, won&rsquo;t be happy till it gets
      you. What say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, he wrestled with me, but I was bricks, and at the end of half
      an hour the only Spargo gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Remember,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;any time you reconsider, I&rsquo;m open. No matter where
      you are, wire me and I&rsquo;ll send the ducats to come on at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thanked him, and asked the pay for my copy&mdash;dope, he called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, regular routine,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Get it the first Thursday after
      publication.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have to trouble you for a few scad until&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked at me and smiled. &lsquo;Better cough up, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sure,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Nobody to identify me, so make it cash.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cash it was made, thirty plunks (a plunk is a dollar, my dear Anak),
      and I pulled my freight... eh?&mdash;oh, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pale youth,&rsquo; I said to Cerberus, &lsquo;I am bounced.&rsquo; (He grinned with pallid
      joy.) &lsquo;And in token of the sincere esteem I bear you, receive this little&mdash;&rsquo; 
      (His eyes flushed and he threw up one hand, swiftly, to guard his head
      from the expected blow)&mdash;&lsquo;this little memento.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had intended to slip a fiver into his hand, but for all his surprise,
      he was too quick for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aw, keep yer dirt,&rsquo; he snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I like you still better,&rsquo; I said, adding a second fiver. &lsquo;You grow
      perfect. But you must take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He backed away growling, but I caught him round the neck, roughed what
      little wind he had out of him, and left him doubled up with the two fives
      in his pocket. But hardly had the elevator started, when the two coins
      tinkled on the roof and fell down between the car and the shaft. As luck
      had it, the door was not closed, and I put out my hand and caught them.
      The elevator boy&rsquo;s eyes bulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a way I have,&rsquo; I said, pocketing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Some bloke&rsquo;s dropped &lsquo;em down the shaft,&rsquo; he whispered, awed by the
      circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It stands to reason,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take charge of &lsquo;em,&rsquo; he volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better turn &lsquo;em over,&rsquo; he threatened, &lsquo;or I stop the works.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stop he did, between floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;have you a mother?&rsquo; (He looked serious, as though
      regretting his act! and further to impress him I rolled up my right sleeve
      with greatest care.) &lsquo;Are you prepared to die?&rsquo; (I got a stealthy crouch
      on, and put a cat-foot forward.) &lsquo;But a minute, a brief minute, stands
      between you and eternity.&rsquo; (Here I crooked my right hand into a claw and
      slid the other foot up.) &lsquo;Young man, young man,&rsquo; I trumpeted, &lsquo;in thirty
      seconds I shall tear your heart dripping from your bosom and stoop to hear
      you shriek in hell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It fetched him. He gave one whoop, the car shot down, and I was on the
      drag. You see, Anak, it&rsquo;s a habit I can&rsquo;t shake off of leaving vivid
      memories behind. No one ever forgets me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not got to the corner when I heard a familiar voice at my shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hello, Cinders! Which way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Chi Slim, who had been with me once when I was thrown off a
      freight in Jacksonville. &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t see &lsquo;em fer cinders,&rsquo; he described it,
      and the monica stuck by me.... Monica? From monos. The tramp nickname.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bound south,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;And how&rsquo;s Slim?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bum. Bulls is horstile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the push?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;At the hang-out. I&rsquo;ll put you wise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the main guy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Me, and don&rsquo;t yer ferget it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lingo was rippling from Leith&rsquo;s lips, but perforce I stopped him.
      &ldquo;Pray translate. Remember, I am a foreigner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully. &ldquo;Slim is in poor luck. Bull means
      policeman. He tells me the bulls are hostile. I ask where the push is, the
      gang he travels with. By putting me wise he will direct me to where the
      gang is hanging out. The main guy is the leader. Slim claims that
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slim and I hiked out to a neck of woods just beyond town, and there was
      the push, a score of husky hobos, charmingly located on the bank of a
      little purling stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come on, you mugs!&rsquo; Slim addressed them. &lsquo;Throw yer feet! Here&rsquo;s
      Cinders, an&rsquo; we must do &lsquo;em proud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which signifies that the hobos had better strike out and do some
      lively begging in order to get the wherewithal to celebrate my return to
      the fold after a year&rsquo;s separation. But I flashed my dough and Slim sent
      several of the younger men off to buy the booze. Take my word for it,
      Anak, it was a blow-out memorable in Trampdom to this day. It&rsquo;s amazing
      the quantity of booze thirty plunks will buy, and it is equally amazing
      the quantity of booze outside of which twenty stiffs will get. Beer and
      cheap wine made up the card, with alcohol thrown in for the
      blowd-in-the-glass stiffs. It was great&mdash;an orgy under the sky, a
      contest of beaker-men, a study in primitive beastliness. To me there is
      something fascinating in a drunken man, and were I a college president I
      should institute P.G. psychology courses in practical drunkenness. It
      would beat the books and compete with the laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of which is neither here nor there, for after sixteen hours of it,
      early next morning, the whole push was copped by an overwhelming array of
      constables and carted off to jail. After breakfast, about ten o&rsquo;clock, we
      were lined upstairs into court, limp and spiritless, the twenty of us. And
      there, under his purple panoply, nose crooked like a Napoleonic eagle and
      eyes glittering and beady, sat Sol Glenhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;John Ambrose!&rsquo; the clerk called out, and Chi Slim, with the ease of long
      practice, stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Vagrant, your Honor,&rsquo; the bailiff volunteered, and his Honor, not
      deigning to look at the prisoner, snapped, &lsquo;Ten days,&rsquo; and Chi Slim sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it went, with the monotony of clockwork, fifteen seconds to the
      man, four men to the minute, the mugs bobbing up and down in turn like
      marionettes. The clerk called the name, the bailiff the offence, the judge
      the sentence, and the man sat down. That was all. Simple, eh? Superb!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chi Slim nudged me. &lsquo;Give&rsquo;m a spiel, Cinders. You kin do it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;G&rsquo;wan,&rsquo; he urged. &lsquo;Give &lsquo;m a ghost story The mugs&rsquo;ll take it all right.
      And you kin throw yer feet fer tobacco for us till we get out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;L. C. Randolph!&rsquo; the clerk called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stood up, but a hitch came in the proceedings. The clerk whispered to
      the judge, and the bailiff smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are a newspaper man, I understand, Mr. Randolph?&rsquo; his Honor remarked
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took me by surprise, for I had forgotten the Cowbell in the excitement
      of succeeding events, and I now saw myself on the edge of the pit I had
      digged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s yer graft. Work it,&rsquo; Slim prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over but the shouting,&rsquo; I groaned back, but Slim, unaware of
      the article, was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your Honor,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;when I can get work, that is my occupation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You take quite an interest in local affairs, I see.&rsquo; (Here his Honor
      took up the morning&rsquo;s Cowbell and ran his eye up and down a column I knew
      was mine.) &lsquo;Color is good,&rsquo; he commented, an appreciative twinkle in his
      eyes; &lsquo;pictures excellent, characterized by broad, Sargent-like effects.
      Now this...t his judge you have depicted... you, ah, draw from life, I
      presume?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Rarely, your I Honor,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Composites, ideals, rather ... er,
      types, I may say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But you have color, sir, unmistakable color,&rsquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is splashed on afterward,&rsquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This judge, then, is not modelled from life, as one might be led to
      believe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, your Honor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, I see, merely a type of judicial wickedness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, more, your Honor,&rsquo; I said boldly, &lsquo;an ideal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Splashed with local color afterward? Ha! Good! And may I venture to ask
      how much you received for this bit of work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thirty dollars, your Honor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hum, good!&rsquo; And his tone abruptly changed. &lsquo;Young man, local color is a
      bad thing. I find you guilty of it and sentence you to thirty days&rsquo; 
      imprisonment, or, at your pleasure, impose a fine of thirty dollars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I spent the thirty dollars in riotous living.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And thirty days more for wasting your substance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Next case!&rsquo; said his Honor to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slim was stunned. &lsquo;Gee!&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;Gee the push gets ten days and
      you get sixty. Gee!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leith struck a match, lighted his dead cigar, and opened the book on his
      knees. &ldquo;Returning to the original conversation, don&rsquo;t you find, Anak, that
      though Loria handles the bipartition of the revenues with scrupulous care,
      he yet omits one important factor, namely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said absently; &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      AMATEUR NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The elevator boy smiled knowingly to himself. When he took her up, he had
      noted the sparkle in her eyes, the color in her cheeks. His little cage
      had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness. And now, on the
      down trip, it was glacier-like. The sparkle and the color were gone. She
      was frowning, and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and
      steel-gray. Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did. He was an observer, and he
      knew it, too, and some day, when he was big enough, he was going to be a
      reporter, sure. And in the meantime he studied the procession of life as
      it streamed up and down eighteen sky-scraper floors in his elevator car.
      He slid the door open for her sympathetically and watched her trip
      determinedly out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a robustness in her carriage which came of the soil rather than
      of the city pavement. But it was a robustness in a finer than the wonted
      sense, a vigorous daintiness, it might be called, which gave an impression
      of virility with none of the womanly left out. It told of a heredity of
      seekers and fighters, of people that worked stoutly with head and hand, of
      ghosts that reached down out of the misty past and moulded and made her to
      be a doer of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was a little angry, and a great deal hurt. &ldquo;I can guess what you
      would tell me,&rdquo; the editor had kindly but firmly interrupted her lengthy
      preamble in the long-looked-forward-to interview just ended. &ldquo;And you have
      told me enough,&rdquo; he had gone on (heartlessly, she was sure, as she went
      over the conversation in its freshness). &ldquo;You have done no newspaper work.
      You are undrilled, undisciplined, unhammered into shape. You have received
      a high-school education, and possibly topped it off with normal school or
      college. You have stood well in English. Your friends have all told you
      how cleverly you write, and how beautifully, and so forth and so forth.
      You think you can do newspaper work, and you want me to put you on. Well,
      I am sorry, but there are no openings. If you knew how crowded&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there are no openings,&rdquo; she had interrupted, in turn, &ldquo;how did
      those who are in, get in? How am I to show that I am eligible to get in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They made themselves indispensable,&rdquo; was the terse response. &ldquo;Make
      yourself indispensable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I, if I do not get the chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; she had insisted, at the same time privately deeming him a most
      unreasonable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? That is your business, not mine,&rdquo; he said conclusively, rising in
      token that the interview was at an end. &ldquo;I must inform you, my dear young
      lady, that there have been at least eighteen other aspiring young ladies
      here this week, and that I have not the time to tell each and every one of
      them how. The function I perform on this paper is hardly that of
      instructor in a school of journalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught an outbound car, and ere she descended from it she had conned
      the conversation over and over again. &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; she repeated to herself,
      as she climbed the three flights of stairs to the rooms where she and her
      sister &ldquo;bach&rsquo;ed.&rdquo; &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; And so she continued to put the
      interrogation, for the stubborn Scotch blood, though many times removed
      from Scottish soil, was still strong in her. And, further, there was need
      that she should learn how. Her sister Letty and she had come up from an
      interior town to the city to make their way in the world. John Wyman was
      land-poor. Disastrous business enterprises had burdened his acres and
      forced his two girls, Edna and Letty, into doing something for themselves.
      A year of school-teaching and of night-study of shorthand and typewriting
      had capitalized their city project and fitted them for the venture, which
      same venture was turning out anything but successful. The city seemed
      crowded with inexperienced stenographers and typewriters, and they had
      nothing but their own inexperience to offer. Edna&rsquo;s secret ambition had
      been journalism; but she had planned a clerical position first, so that
      she might have time and space in which to determine where and on what line
      of journalism she would embark. But the clerical position had not been
      forthcoming, either for Letty or her, and day by day their little hoard
      dwindled, though the room rent remained normal and the stove consumed coal
      with undiminished voracity. And it was a slim little hoard by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Max Irwin,&rdquo; Letty said, talking it over. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a journalist with
      a national reputation. Go and see him, Ed. He knows how, and he should be
      able to tell you how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; Edna objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than you knew the editor you saw to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; (long and judicially), &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit different from the strange men and women you&rsquo;ll interview when
      you&rsquo;ve learned how,&rdquo; Letty encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t looked at it in that light,&rdquo; Edna conceded. &ldquo;After all, where&rsquo;s
      the difference between interviewing Mr. Max Irwin for some paper, or
      interviewing Mr. Max Irwin for myself? It will be practice, too. I&rsquo;ll go
      and look him up in the directory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letty, I know I can write if I get the chance,&rdquo; she announced decisively
      a moment later. &ldquo;I just FEEL that I have the feel of it, if you know what
      I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Letty knew and nodded. &ldquo;I wonder what he is like?&rdquo; she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it my business to find out,&rdquo; Edna assured her; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll let
      you know inside forty-eight hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Letty clapped her hands. &ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s the newspaper spirit! Make it
      twenty-four hours and you are perfect!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    *       *       *
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and I am very sorry to trouble you,&rdquo; she concluded the statement
      of her case to Max Irwin, famous war correspondent and veteran journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered, with a deprecatory wave of the hand. &ldquo;If you
      don&rsquo;t do your own talking, who&rsquo;s to do it for you? Now I understand your
      predicament precisely. You want to get on the Intelligencer, you want to
      get in at once, and you have had no previous experience. In the first
      place, then, have you any pull? There are a dozen men in the city, a line
      from whom would be an open-sesame. After that you would stand or fall by
      your own ability. There&rsquo;s Senator Longbridge, for instance, and Claus
      Inskeep the street-car magnate, and Lane, and McChesney&mdash;&rdquo; He paused,
      with voice suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I know none of them,&rdquo; she answered despondently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary. Do you know any one that knows them? or any one that
      knows any one else that knows them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must think of something else,&rdquo; he went on, cheerfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      have to do something yourself. Let me see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and thought for a moment, with closed eyes and wrinkled
      forehead. She was watching him, studying him intently, when his blue eyes
      opened with a snap and his face suddenly brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it! But no, wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for a minute it was his turn to study her. And study her he did, till
      she could feel her cheeks flushing under his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, I think, though it remains to be seen,&rdquo; he said enigmatically.
      &ldquo;It will show the stuff that&rsquo;s in you, besides, and it will be a better
      claim upon the Intelligencer people than all the lines from all the
      senators and magnates in the world. The thing for you is to do Amateur
      Night at the Loops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hardly understand,&rdquo; Edna said, for his suggestion conveyed no
      meaning to her. &ldquo;What are the &lsquo;Loops&rsquo;? and what is &lsquo;Amateur Night&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot you said you were from the interior. But so much the better, if
      you&rsquo;ve only got the journalistic grip. It will be a first impression, and
      first impressions are always unbiased, unprejudiced, fresh, vivid. The
      Loops are out on the rim of the city, near the Park,&mdash;a place of
      diversion. There&rsquo;s a scenic railway, a water toboggan slide, a concert
      band, a theatre, wild animals, moving pictures, and so forth and so forth.
      The common people go there to look at the animals and enjoy themselves,
      and the other people go there to enjoy themselves by watching the common
      people enjoy themselves. A democratic, fresh-air-breathing, frolicking
      affair, that&rsquo;s what the Loops are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the theatre is what concerns you. It&rsquo;s vaudeville. One turn follows
      another&mdash;jugglers, acrobats, rubber-jointed wonders, fire-dancers,
      coon-song artists, singers, players, female impersonators, sentimental
      soloists, and so forth and so forth. These people are professional
      vaudevillists. They make their living that way. Many are excellently paid.
      Some are free rovers, doing a turn wherever they can get an opening, at
      the Obermann, the Orpheus, the Alcatraz, the Louvre, and so forth and so
      forth. Others cover circuit pretty well all over the country. An
      interesting phase of life, and the pay is big enough to attract many
      aspirants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now the management of the Loops, in its bid for popularity, instituted
      what is called &lsquo;Amateur Night&rsquo;; that is to say, twice a week, after the
      professionals have done their turns, the stage is given over to the
      aspiring amateurs. The audience remains to criticise. The populace becomes
      the arbiter of art&mdash;or it thinks it does, which is the same thing;
      and it pays its money and is well pleased with itself, and Amateur Night
      is a paying proposition to the management.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the point of Amateur Night, and it is well to note it, is that these
      amateurs are not really amateurs. They are paid for doing their turn. At
      the best, they may be termed &lsquo;professional amateurs.&rsquo; It stands to reason
      that the management could not get people to face a rampant audience for
      nothing, and on such occasions the audience certainly goes mad. It&rsquo;s great
      fun&mdash;for the audience. But the thing for you to do, and it requires
      nerve, I assure you, is to go out, make arrangements for two turns,
      (Wednesday and Saturday nights, I believe), do your two turns, and write
      it up for the Sunday Intelligencer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; she quavered, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; and there was a
      suggestion of disappointment and tears in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;You were expecting something else, something
      different, something better. We all do at first. But remember the admiral
      of the Queen&rsquo;s Na-vee, who swept the floor and polished up the handle of
      the big front door. You must face the drudgery of apprenticeship or quit
      right now. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abruptness with which he demanded her decision startled her. As she
      faltered, she could see a shade of disappointment beginning to darken his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way it must be considered a test,&rdquo; he added encouragingly. &ldquo;A severe
      one, but so much the better. Now is the time. Are you game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she said faintly, at the same time making a note of the
      directness, abruptness, and haste of these city men with whom she was
      coming in contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Why, when I started in, I had the dreariest, deadliest details
      imaginable. And after that, for a weary time, I did the police and divorce
      courts. But it all came well in the end and did me good. You are luckier
      in making your start with Sunday work. It&rsquo;s not particularly great. What
      of it? Do it. Show the stuff you&rsquo;re made of, and you&rsquo;ll get a call for
      better work&mdash;better class and better pay. Now you go out this
      afternoon to the Loops, and engage to do two turns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what kind of turns can I do?&rdquo; Edna asked dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? That&rsquo;s easy. Can you sing? Never mind, don&rsquo;t need to sing. Screech,
      do anything&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re paid for, to afford amusement, to
      give bad art for the populace to howl down. And when you do your turn,
      take some one along for chaperon. Be afraid of no one. Talk up. Move about
      among the amateurs waiting their turn, pump them, study them, photograph
      them in your brain. Get the atmosphere, the color, strong color, lots of
      it. Dig right in with both hands, and get the essence of it, the spirit,
      the significance. What does it mean? Find out what it means. That&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;re there for. That&rsquo;s what the readers of the Sunday Intelligencer want
      to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be terse in style, vigorous of phrase, apt, concretely apt, in
      similitude. Avoid platitudes and commonplaces. Exercise selection. Seize
      upon things salient, eliminate the rest, and you have pictures. Paint
      those pictures in words and the Intelligencer will have you. Get hold of a
      few back numbers, and study the Sunday Intelligencer feature story. Tell
      it all in the opening paragraph as advertisement of contents, and in the
      contents tell it all over again. Then put a snapper at the end, so if
      they&rsquo;re crowded for space they can cut off your contents anywhere,
      reattach the snapper, and the story will still retain form. There, that&rsquo;s
      enough. Study the rest out for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both rose to their feet, Edna quite carried away by his enthusiasm
      and his quick, jerky sentences, bristling with the things she wanted to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember, Miss Wyman, if you&rsquo;re ambitious, that the aim and end of
      journalism is not the feature article. Avoid the rut. The feature is a
      trick. Master it, but don&rsquo;t let it master you. But master it you must; for
      if you can&rsquo;t learn to do a feature well, you can never expect to do
      anything better. In short, put your whole self into it, and yet, outside
      of it, above it, remain yourself, if you follow me. And now good luck to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the door and were shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one thing more,&rdquo; he interrupted her thanks, &ldquo;let me see your copy
      before you turn it in. I may be able to put you straight here and there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna found the manager of the Loops a full-fleshed, heavy-jowled man,
      bushy of eyebrow and generally belligerent of aspect, with an
      absent-minded scowl on his face and a black cigar stuck in the midst
      thereof. Symes was his name, she had learned, Ernst Symes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatcher turn?&rdquo; he demanded, ere half her brief application had left her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentimental soloist, soprano,&rdquo; she answered promptly, remembering Irwin&rsquo;s
      advice to talk up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatcher name?&rdquo; Mr. Symes asked, scarcely deigning to glance at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. So rapidly had she been rushed into the adventure that she
      had not considered the question of a name at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any name? Stage name?&rdquo; he bellowed impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nan Bellayne,&rdquo; she invented on the spur of the moment. &ldquo;B-e-l-l-a-y-n-e.
      Yes, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scribbled it into a notebook. &ldquo;All right. Take your turn Wednesday and
      Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do I get?&rdquo; Edna demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two-an&rsquo;-a-half a turn. Two turns, five. Getcher pay first Monday after
      second turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without the simple courtesy of &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; he turned his back on her
      and plunged into the newspaper he had been reading when she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edna came early on Wednesday evening, Letty with her, and in a telescope
      basket her costume&mdash;a simple affair. A plaid shawl borrowed from the
      washerwoman, a ragged scrubbing skirt borrowed from the charwoman, and a
      gray wig rented from a costumer for twenty-five cents a night, completed
      the outfit; for Edna had elected to be an old Irishwoman singing
      broken-heartedly after her wandering boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though they had come early, she found everything in uproar. The main
      performance was under way, the orchestra was playing and the audience
      intermittently applauding. The infusion of the amateurs clogged the
      working of things behind the stage, crowded the passages, dressing rooms,
      and wings, and forced everybody into everybody else&rsquo;s way. This was
      particularly distasteful to the professionals, who carried themselves as
      befitted those of a higher caste, and whose behavior toward the pariah
      amateurs was marked by hauteur and even brutality. And Edna, bullied and
      elbowed and shoved about, clinging desperately to her basket and seeking a
      dressing room, took note of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dressing room she finally found, jammed with three other amateur
      &ldquo;ladies,&rdquo; who were &ldquo;making up&rdquo; with much noise, high-pitched voices, and
      squabbling over a lone mirror. Her own make-up was so simple that it was
      quickly accomplished, and she left the trio of ladies holding an armed
      truce while they passed judgment upon her. Letty was close at her
      shoulder, and with patience and persistence they managed to get a nook in
      one of the wings which commanded a view of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small, dark man, dapper and debonair, swallow-tailed and top-hatted, was
      waltzing about the stage with dainty, mincing steps, and in a thin little
      voice singing something or other about somebody or something evidently
      pathetic. As his waning voice neared the end of the lines, a large woman,
      crowned with an amazing wealth of blond hair, thrust rudely past Edna,
      trod heavily on her toes, and shoved her contemptuously to the side.
      &ldquo;Bloomin&rsquo; hamateur!&rdquo; she hissed as she went past, and the next instant she
      was on the stage, graciously bowing to the audience, while the small, dark
      man twirled extravagantly about on his tiptoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, girls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This greeting, drawled with an inimitable vocal caress in every syllable,
      close in her ear, caused Edna to give a startled little jump. A
      smooth-faced, moon-faced young man was smiling at her good-naturedly. His
      &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; was plainly that of the stock tramp of the stage, though the
      inevitable whiskers were lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it don&rsquo;t take a minute to slap&rsquo;m on,&rdquo; he explained, divining the
      search in her eyes and waving in his hand the adornment in question. &ldquo;They
      make a feller sweat,&rdquo; he explained further. And then, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer turn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soprano&mdash;sentimental,&rdquo; she answered, trying to be offhand and at
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whata you doin&rsquo; it for?&rdquo; he demanded directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For fun; what else?&rdquo; she countered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just sized you up for that as soon as I put eyes on you. You ain&rsquo;t
      graftin&rsquo; for a paper, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met but one editor in my life,&rdquo; she replied evasively, &ldquo;and I, he&mdash;well,
      we didn&rsquo;t get on very well together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hittin&rsquo; &lsquo;m for a job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna nodded carelessly, though inwardly anxious and cudgelling her brains
      for something to turn the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That eighteen other girls had already been there that week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gave you the icy mit, eh?&rdquo; The moon-faced young man laughed and slapped
      his thighs. &ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;re kind of suspicious. The Sunday papers &lsquo;d like
      to get Amateur Night done up brown in a nice little package, and the
      manager don&rsquo;t see it that way. Gets wild-eyed at the thought of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your turn?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? me? Oh, I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; the tramp act tonight. I&rsquo;m Charley Welsh, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt that by the mention of his name he intended to convey to her
      complete enlightenment, but the best she could do was to say politely,
      &ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to laugh at the hurt disappointment which came into his face,
      but concealed her amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; he said brusquely, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t stand there and tell me you&rsquo;ve
      never heard of Charley Welsh? Well, you must be young. Why, I&rsquo;m an Only,
      the Only amateur at that. Sure, you must have seen me. I&rsquo;m everywhere. I
      could be a professional, but I get more dough out of it by doin&rsquo; the
      amateur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s an &lsquo;Only&rsquo;?&rdquo; she queried. &ldquo;I want to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Charley Welsh said gallantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put you wise. An &lsquo;Only&rsquo; is a
      nonpareil, the feller that does one kind of a turn better&rsquo;n any other
      feller. He&rsquo;s the Only, see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Edna saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get a line on the biz,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;throw yer lamps on me. I&rsquo;m the
      Only all-round amateur. To-night I make a bluff at the tramp act. It&rsquo;s
      harder to bluff it than to really do it, but then it&rsquo;s acting, it&rsquo;s
      amateur, it&rsquo;s art. See? I do everything, from Sheeny monologue to team
      song and dance and Dutch comedian. Sure, I&rsquo;m Charley Welsh, the Only
      Charley Welsh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in this fashion, while the thin, dark man and the large, blond woman
      warbled dulcetly out on the stage and the other professionals followed in
      their turns, did Charley Welsh put Edna wise, giving her much
      miscellaneous and superfluous information and much that she stored away
      for the Sunday Intelligencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tra la loo,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s his highness chasin&rsquo; you
      up. Yer first on the bill. Never mind the row when you go on. Just finish
      yer turn like a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at that moment that Edna felt her journalistic ambition departing
      from her, and was aware of an overmastering desire to be somewhere else.
      But the stage manager, like an ogre, barred her retreat. She could hear
      the opening bars of her song going up from the orchestra and the noises of
      the house dying away to the silence of anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Letty whispered, pressing her hand; and from the other side
      came the peremptory &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flunk!&rdquo; of Charley Welsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her feet seemed rooted to the floor, and she leaned weakly against a
      shift scene. The orchestra was beginning over again, and a lone voice from
      the house piped with startling distinctness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puzzle picture! Find Nannie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A roar of laughter greeted the sally, and Edna shrank back. But the strong
      hand of the manager descended on her shoulder, and with a quick, powerful
      shove propelled her out on to the stage. His hand and arm had flashed into
      full view, and the audience, grasping the situation, thundered its
      appreciation. The orchestra was drowned out by the terrible din, and Edna
      could see the bows scraping away across the violins, apparently without
      sound. It was impossible for her to begin in time, and as she patiently
      waited, arms akimbo and ears straining for the music, the house let loose
      again (a favorite trick, she afterward learned, of confusing the amateur
      by preventing him or her from hearing the orchestra).
    </p>
    <p>
      But Edna was recovering her presence of mind. She became aware, pit to
      dome, of a vast sea of smiling and fun-distorted faces, of vast roars of
      laughter, rising wave on wave, and then her Scotch blood went cold and
      angry. The hard-working but silent orchestra gave her the cue, and,
      without making a sound, she began to move her lips, stretch forth her
      arms, and sway her body, as though she were really singing. The noise in
      the house redoubled in the attempt to drown her voice, but she serenely
      went on with her pantomime. This seemed to continue an interminable time,
      when the audience, tiring of its prank and in order to hear, suddenly
      stilled its clamor, and discovered the dumb show she had been making. For
      a moment all was silent, save for the orchestra, her lips moving on
      without a sound, and then the audience realized that it had been sold, and
      broke out afresh, this time with genuine applause in acknowledgment of her
      victory. She chose this as the happy moment for her exit, and with a bow
      and a backward retreat, she was off the stage in Letty&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst was past, and for the rest of the evening she moved about among
      the amateurs and professionals, talking, listening, observing, finding out
      what it meant and taking mental notes of it all. Charley Welsh constituted
      himself her preceptor and guardian angel, and so well did he perform the
      self-allotted task that when it was all over she felt fully prepared to
      write her article. But the proposition had been to do two turns, and her
      native pluck forced her to live up to it. Also, in the course of the
      intervening days, she discovered fleeting impressions that required
      verification; so, on Saturday, she was back again, with her telescope
      basket and Letty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager seemed looking for her, and she caught an expression of relief
      in his eyes when he first saw her. He hurried up, greeted her, and bowed
      with a respect ludicrously at variance with his previous ogre-like
      behavior. And as he bowed, across his shoulders she saw Charley Welsh
      deliberately wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the surprise had just begun. The manager begged to be introduced to
      her sister, chatted entertainingly with the pair of them, and strove
      greatly and anxiously to be agreeable. He even went so far as to give Edna
      a dressing room to herself, to the unspeakable envy of the three other
      amateur ladies of previous acquaintance. Edna was nonplussed, and it was
      not till she met Charley Welsh in the passage that light was thrown on the
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he greeted her. &ldquo;On Easy Street, eh? Everything slidin&rsquo; your
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinks yer a female reporter, sure. I almost split when I saw&rsquo;m layin&rsquo; 
      himself out sweet an&rsquo; pleasin&rsquo;. Honest, now, that ain&rsquo;t yer graft, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you my experience with editors,&rdquo; she parried. &ldquo;And honest now, it
      was honest, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Only Charley Welsh shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;Not that I care a
      rap,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;And if you are, just gimme a couple of lines of
      notice, the right kind, good ad, you know. And if yer not, why yer all
      right anyway. Yer not our class, that&rsquo;s straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After her turn, which she did this time with the nerve of an old
      campaigner, the manager returned to the charge; and after saying nice
      things and being generally nice himself, he came to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll treat us well, I hope,&rdquo; he said insinuatingly. &ldquo;Do the right thing
      by us, and all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered innocently, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t persuade me to do another
      turn; I know I seemed to take and that you&rsquo;d like to have me, but I
      really, really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; he said, with a touch of his old bulldozing
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I really won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;Vaudeville&rsquo;s too&mdash;too wearing
      on the nerves, my nerves, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereat he looked puzzled and doubtful, and forbore to press the point
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on Monday morning, when she came to his office to get her pay for the
      two turns, it was he who puzzled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely must have mistaken me,&rdquo; he lied glibly. &ldquo;I remember saying
      something about paying your car fare. We always do this, you know, but we
      never, never pay amateurs. That would take the life and sparkle out of the
      whole thing. No, Charley Welsh was stringing you. He gets paid nothing for
      his turns. No amateur gets paid. The idea is ridiculous. However, here&rsquo;s
      fifty cents. It will pay your sister&rsquo;s car fare also. And,&rdquo;&mdash;very
      suavely,&mdash;&ldquo;speaking for the Loops, permit me to thank you for the
      kind and successful contribution of your services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, true to her promise to Max Irwin, she placed her
      typewritten copy into his hands. And while he ran over it, he nodded his
      head from time to time, and maintained a running fire of commendatory
      remarks: &ldquo;Good!&mdash;that&rsquo;s it!&mdash;that&rsquo;s the stuff!&mdash;psychology&rsquo;s
      all right!&mdash;the very idea!&mdash;you&rsquo;ve caught it!&mdash;excellent!&mdash;missed
      it a bit here, but it&rsquo;ll go&mdash;that&rsquo;s vigorous!&mdash;strong!&mdash;vivid!&mdash;pictures!
      pictures!&mdash;excellent!&mdash;most excellent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he had run down to the bottom of the last page, holding out his
      hand: &ldquo;My dear Miss Wyman, I congratulate you. I must say you have
      exceeded my expectations, which, to say the least, were large. You are a
      journalist, a natural journalist. You&rsquo;ve got the grip, and you&rsquo;re sure to
      get on. The Intelligencer will take it, without doubt, and take you too.
      They&rsquo;ll have to take you. If they don&rsquo;t, some of the other papers will get
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he queried, the next instant, his face going serious.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said nothing about receiving the pay for your turns, and that&rsquo;s
      one of the points of the feature. I expressly mentioned it, if you&rsquo;ll
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will never do,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head ominously, when she had
      explained. &ldquo;You simply must collect that money somehow. Let me see. Let me
      think a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Mr. Irwin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bothered you enough. Let me use
      your &lsquo;phone, please, and I&rsquo;ll try Mr. Ernst Symes again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He vacated his chair by the desk, and Edna took down the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley Welsh is sick,&rdquo; she began, when the connection had been made.
      &ldquo;What? No I&rsquo;m not Charley Welsh. Charley Welsh is sick, and his sister
      wants to know if she can come out this afternoon and draw his pay for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Charley Welsh&rsquo;s sister that Charley Welsh was out this morning, and
      drew his own pay,&rdquo; came back the manager&rsquo;s familiar tones, crisp with
      asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Edna went on. &ldquo;And now Nan Bellayne wants to know if she and
      her sister can come out this afternoon and draw Nan Bellayne&rsquo;s pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d he say? What&rsquo;d he say?&rdquo; Max Irwin cried excitedly, as she hung up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Nan Bellayne was too much for him, and that she and her sister could
      come out and get her pay and the freedom of the Loops, to boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing, more,&rdquo; he interrupted her thanks at the door, as on her
      previous visit. &ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve shown the stuff you&rsquo;re made of, I should
      esteem it, ahem, a privilege to give you a line myself to the
      Intelligencer people.&rdquo;

      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wade Atsheler is dead&mdash;dead by his own hand. To say that this was
      entirely unexpected by the small coterie which knew him, would be to say
      an untruth; and yet never once had we, his intimates, ever canvassed the
      idea. Rather had we been prepared for it in some incomprehensible
      subconscious way. Before the perpetration of the deed, its possibility is
      remotest from our thoughts; but when we did know that he was dead, it
      seemed, somehow, that we had understood and looked forward to it all the
      time. This, by retrospective analysis, we could easily explain by the fact
      of his great trouble. I use &ldquo;great trouble&rdquo; advisedly. Young, handsome,
      with an assured position as the right-hand man of Eben Hale, the great
      street-railway magnate, there could be no reason for him to complain of
      fortune&rsquo;s favors. Yet we had watched his smooth brow furrow and corrugate
      as under some carking care or devouring sorrow. We had watched his thick,
      black hair thin and silver as green grain under brazen skies and parching
      drought. Who can forget, in the midst of the hilarious scenes he toward
      the last sought with greater and greater avidity&mdash;who can forget, I
      say, the deep abstractions and black moods into which he fell? At such
      times, when the fun rippled and soared from height to height, suddenly,
      without rhyme or reason, his eyes would turn lacklustre, his brows knit,
      as with clenched hands and face overshot with spasms of mental pain he
      wrestled on the edge of the abyss with some unknown danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never spoke of his trouble, nor were we indiscreet enough to ask. But
      it was just as well; for had we, and had he spoken, our help and strength
      could have availed nothing. When Eben Hale died, whose confidential
      secretary he was&mdash;nay, well-nigh adopted son and full business
      partner&mdash;he no longer came among us. Not, as I now know, that our
      company was distasteful to him, but because his trouble had so grown that
      he could not respond to our happiness nor find surcease with us. Why this
      should be so we could not at the time understand, for when Eben Hale&rsquo;s
      will was probated, the world learned that he was sole heir to his
      employer&rsquo;s many millions, and it was expressly stipulated that this great
      inheritance was given to him without qualification, hitch, or hindrance in
      the exercise thereof. Not a share of stock, not a penny of cash, was
      bequeathed to the dead man&rsquo;s relatives. As for his direct family, one
      astounding clause expressly stated that Wade Atsheler was to dispense to
      Eben Hale&rsquo;s wife and sons and daughters whatever moneys his judgement
      dictated, at whatever times he deemed advisable. Had there been any
      scandal in the dead man&rsquo;s family, or had his sons been wild or undutiful,
      then there might have been a glimmering of reason in this most unusual
      action; but Eben Hale&rsquo;s domestic happiness had been proverbial in the
      community, and one would have to travel far and wide to discover a
      cleaner, saner, wholesomer progeny of sons and daughters. While his wife&mdash;well,
      by those who knew her best she was endearingly termed &ldquo;The Mother of the
      Gracchi.&rdquo; Needless to state, this inexplicable will was a nine day&rsquo;s
      wonder; but the expectant public was disappointed in that no contest was
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the other day that Eben Hale was laid away in his stately
      marble mausoleum. And now Wade Atsheler is dead. The news was printed in
      this morning&rsquo;s paper. I have just received through the mail a letter from
      him, posted, evidently, but a short hour before he hurled himself into
      eternity. This letter, which lies before me, is a narrative in his own
      handwriting, linking together numerous newspaper clippings and facsimiles
      of letters. The original correspondence, he has told me, is in the hands
      of the police. He has begged me, also, as a warning to society against a
      most frightful and diabolical danger which threatens its very existence,
      to make public the terrible series of tragedies in which he has been
      innocently concerned. I herewith append the text in full:
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in August, 1899, just after my return from my summer vacation, that
      the blow fell. We did not know it at the time; we had not yet learned to
      school our minds to such awful possibilities. Mr. Hale opened the letter,
      read it, and tossed it upon my desk with a laugh. When I had looked it
      over, I also laughed, saying, &ldquo;Some ghastly joke, Mr. Hale, and one in
      very poor taste.&rdquo; Find here, my dear John, an exact duplicate of the
      letter in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. OF M. August 17, 1899.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;We desire you to realize upon whatever portion of your
      vast holdings is necessary to obtain, IN CASH, twenty millions of dollars.
      This sum we require you to pay over to us, or to our agents. You will note
      we do not specify any given time, for it is not our wish to hurry you in
      this matter. You may even, if it be easier for you, pay us in ten,
      fifteen, or twenty instalments; but we will accept no single instalment of
      less than a million.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe us, dear Mr. Hale, when we say that we embark upon this course of
      action utterly devoid of animus. We are members of that intellectual
      proletariat, the increasing numbers of which mark in red lettering the
      last days of the nineteenth century. We have, from a thorough study of
      economics, decided to enter upon this business. It has many merits, chief
      among which may be noted that we can indulge in large and lucrative
      operations without capital. So far, we have been fairly successful, and we
      hope our dealings with you may be pleasant and satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pray attend while we explain our views more fully. At the base of the
      present system of society is to be found the property right. And this
      right of the individual to hold property is demonstrated, in the last
      analysis, to rest solely and wholly upon MIGHT. The mailed gentlemen of
      William the Conqueror divided and apportioned England amongst themselves
      with the naked sword. This, we are sure you will grant, is true of all
      feudal possessions. With the invention of steam and the Industrial
      Revolution there came into existence the Capitalist Class, in the modern
      sense of the word. These capitalists quickly towered above the ancient
      nobility. The captains of industry have virtually dispossessed the
      descendants of the captains of war. Mind, and not muscle, wins in to-day&rsquo;s
      struggle for existence. But this state of affairs is none the less based
      upon might. The change has been qualitative. The old-time Feudal Baronage
      ravaged the world with fire and sword; the modern Money Baronage exploits
      the world by mastering and applying the world&rsquo;s economic forces. Brain,
      and not brawn, endures; and those best fitted to survive are the
      intellectually and commercially powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We, the M. of M., are not content to become wage slaves. The great trusts
      and business combinations (with which you have your rating) prevent us
      from rising to the place among you which our intellects qualify us to
      occupy. Why? Because we are without capital. We are of the unwashed, but
      with this difference: our brains are of the best, and we have no foolish
      ethical nor social scruples. As wage slaves, toiling early and late, and
      living abstemiously, we could not save in threescore years&mdash;nor in
      twenty times threescore years&mdash;a sum of money sufficient successfully
      to cope with the great aggregations of massed capital which now exist.
      Nevertheless, we have entered the arena. We now throw down the gage to the
      capital of the world. Whether it wishes to fight or not, it shall have to
      fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hale, our interests dictate us to demand of you twenty millions of
      dollars. While we are considerate enough to give you reasonable time in
      which to carry out your share of the transaction, please do not delay too
      long. When you have agreed to our terms, insert a suitable notice in the
      agony column of the &ldquo;Morning Blazer.&rdquo; We shall then acquaint you with our
      plan for transferring the sum mentioned. You had better do this some time
      prior to October 1st. If you do not, in order to show that we are in
      earnest we shall on that date kill a man on East Thirty-ninth Street. He
      will be a workingman. This man you do not know; nor do we. You represent a
      force in modern society; we also represent a force&mdash;a new force.
      Without anger or malice, we have closed in battle. As you will readily
      discern, we are simply a business proposition. You are the upper, and we
      the nether, millstone; this man&rsquo;s life shall be ground out between. You
      may save him if you agree to our conditions and act in time.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I leave it to you, dear John, why should we not have laughed over such a
      preposterous communication? The idea, we could not but grant, was well
      conceived, but it was too grotesque to be taken seriously. Mr. Hale said
      he would preserve it as a literary curiosity, and shoved it away in a
      pigeonhole. Then we promptly forgot its existence. And as promptly, on the
      1st of October, going over the morning mail, we read the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. OF M., October 1, 1899.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Your victim has met his fate. An hour ago, on East
      Thirty-ninth Street, a workingman was thrust through the heart with a
      knife. Ere you read this his body will be lying at the Morgue. Go and look
      upon your handiwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      On October 14th, in token of our earnestness in this matter, and in case
      you do not relent, we shall kill a policeman on or near the corner of Polk
      Street and Clermont Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very cordially,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Hale laughed. His mind was full of a prospective deal with a
      Chicago syndicate for the sale of all his street railways in that city,
      and so he went on dictating to the stenographer, never giving it a second
      thought. But somehow, I know not why, a heavy depression fell upon me.
      What if it were not a joke, I asked myself, and turned involuntarily to
      the morning paper. There it was, as befitted an obscure person of the
      lower classes, a paltry half-dozen lines tucked away in a corner, next a
      patent medicine advertisement:
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after five o&rsquo;clock this morning, on East Thirty-ninth Street, a
      laborer named Pete Lascalle, while on his way to work, was stabbed to the
      heart by an unknown assailant, who escaped by running. The police have
      been unable to discover any motive for the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; was Mr. Hale&rsquo;s rejoinder, when I had read the item aloud;
      but the incident evidently weighed upon his mind, for late in the
      afternoon, with many epithets denunciatory of his foolishness, he asked me
      to acquaint the police with the affair. I had the pleasure of being
      laughed at in the Inspector&rsquo;s private office, although I went away with
      the assurance that they would look into it and that the vicinity of Polk
      and Clermont would be doubly patrolled on the night mentioned. There it
      dropped, till the two weeks had sped by, when the following note came to
      us through the mail:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. OF M. October 15, 1899.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Your second victim has fallen on schedule time. We are in
      no hurry; but to increase the pressure we shall henceforth kill weekly. To
      protect ourselves against police interference we shall hereafter inform
      you of the event but a little prior to or simultaneously with the deed.
      Trusting this finds you in good health,
    </p>
    <p>
      We are,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Mr. Hale took up the paper, and after a brief search, read to me
      this account:
    </p>
    <p>
      A DASTARDLY CRIME
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Donahue, assigned only last night to special patrol duty in the
      Eleventh Ward, at midnight was shot through the brain and instantly
      killed. The tragedy was enacted in the full glare of the street lights on
      the corner of Polk Street and Clermont Avenue. Our society is indeed
      unstable when the custodians of its peace are thus openly and wantonly
      shot down. The police have so far been unable to obtain the slightest
      clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barely had he finished this when the police arrived&mdash;the Inspector
      himself and two of his keenest sleuths. Alarm sat upon their faces, and it
      was plain that they were seriously perturbed. Though the facts were so few
      and simple, we talked long, going over the affair again and again. When
      the Inspector went away, he confidently assured us that everything would
      soon be straightened out and the assassins run to earth. In the meantime
      he thought it well to detail guards for the protection of Mr. Hale and
      myself, and several more to be constantly on the vigil about the house and
      grounds. After the lapse of a week, at one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, this
      telegram was received:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. OF M. October 21, 1899.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;We are sorry to note how completely you have misunderstood
      us. You have seen fit to surround yourself and household with armed
      guards, as though, forsooth, we were common criminals, apt to break in
      upon you and wrest away by force your twenty millions. Believe us, this is
      farthest from our intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will readily comprehend, after a little sober thought, that your life
      is dear to us. Do not be afraid. We would not hurt you for the world. It
      is our policy to cherish you tenderly and protect you from all harm. Your
      death means nothing to us. If it did, rest assured that we would not
      hesitate a moment in destroying you. Think this over, Mr. Hale. When you
      have paid us our price, there will be need of retrenchment. Dismiss your
      guards now, and cut down your expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within minutes of the time you receive this a nurse-girl will have been
      choked to death in Brentwood Park. The body may be found in the shrubbery
      lining the path which leads off to the left from the band-stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cordially yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant Mr. Hale was at the telephone, warning the Inspector of
      the impending murder. The Inspector excused himself in order to call up
      Police Sub-station F and despatch men to the scene. Fifteen minutes later
      he rang us up and informed us that the body had been discovered, yet warm,
      in the place indicated. That evening the papers teemed with glaring
      Jack-the-Strangler headlines, denouncing the brutality of the deed and
      complaining about the laxity of the police. We were also closeted with the
      Inspector, who begged us by all means to keep the affair secret. Success,
      he said, depended upon silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you know, John, Mr. Hale was a man of iron. He refused to surrender.
      But, oh, John, it was terrible, nay, horrible&mdash;this awful something,
      this blind force in the dark. We could not fight, could not plan, could do
      nothing save hold our hands and wait. And week by week, as certain as the
      rising of the sun, came the notification and death of some person, man or
      woman, innocent of evil, but just as much killed by us as though we had
      done it with our own hands. A word from Mr. Hale and the slaughter would
      have ceased. But he hardened his heart and waited, the lines deepening,
      the mouth and eyes growing sterner and firmer, and the face aging with the
      hours. It is needless for me to speak of my own suffering during that
      frightful period. Find here the letters and telegrams of the M. of M., and
      the newspaper accounts, etc., of the various murders.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will notice also the letters warning Mr. Hale of certain machinations
      of commercial enemies and secret manipulations of stock. The M. of M.
      seemed to have its hand on the inner pulse of the business and financial
      world. They possessed themselves of and forwarded to us information which
      our agents could not obtain. One timely note from them, at a critical
      moment in a certain deal, saved all of five millions to Mr. Hale. At
      another time they sent us a telegram which probably was the means of
      preventing an anarchist crank from taking my employer&rsquo;s life. We captured
      the man on his arrival and turned him over to the police, who found upon
      him enough of a new and powerful explosive to sink a battleship.
    </p>
    <p>
      We persisted. Mr. Hale was grit clear through. He disbursed at the rate of
      one hundred thousand per week for secret service. The aid of the
      Pinkertons and of countless private detective agencies was called in, and
      in addition to this thousands were upon our payroll. Our agents swarmed
      everywhere, in all guises, penetrating all classes of society. They
      grasped at a myriad clues; hundreds of suspects were jailed, and at
      various times thousands of suspicious persons were under surveillance, but
      nothing tangible came to light. With its communications the M. of M.
      continually changed its method of delivery. And every messenger they sent
      us was arrested forthwith. But these inevitably proved to be innocent
      individuals, while their descriptions of the persons who had employed them
      for the errand never tallied. On the last day of December we received this
      notification:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. OF M., December 31, 1899.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Pursuant of our policy, with which we flatter ourselves
      you are already well versed, we beg to state that we shall give a passport
      from this Vale of Tears to Inspector Bying, with whom, because of our
      attentions, you have become so well acquainted. It is his custom to be in
      his private office at this hour. Even as you read this he breathes his
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cordially yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped the letter and sprang to the telephone. Great was my relief when
      I heard the Inspector&rsquo;s hearty voice. But, even as he spoke, his voice
      died away in the receiver to a gurgling sob, and I heard faintly the crash
      of a falling body. Then a strange voice hello&rsquo;d me, sent me the regards of
      the M. of M., and broke the switch. Like a flash I called up the public
      office of the Central Police, telling them to go at once to the
      Inspector&rsquo;s aid in his private office. I then held the line, and a few
      minutes later received the intelligence that he had been found bathed in
      his own blood and breathing his last. There were no eyewitnesses, and no
      trace was discoverable of the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mr. Hale immediately increased his secret service till a quarter
      of a million flowed weekly from his coffers. He was determined to win out.
      His graduated rewards aggregated over ten millions. You have a fair idea
      of his resources and you can see in what manner he drew upon them. It was
      the principle, he affirmed, that he was fighting for, not the gold. And it
      must be admitted that his course proved the nobility of his motive. The
      police departments of all the great cities cooperated, and even the United
      States Government stepped in, and the affair became one of the highest
      questions of state. Certain contingent funds of the nation were devoted to
      the unearthing of the M. of M., and every government agent was on the
      alert. But all in vain. The Minions of Midas carried on their damnable
      work unhampered. They had their way and struck unerringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he fought to the last, Mr. Hale could not wash his hands of the
      blood with which they were dyed. Though not technically a murderer, though
      no jury of his peers would ever have convicted him, none the less the
      death of every individual was due to him. As I said before, a word from
      him and the slaughter would have ceased. But he refused to give that word.
      He insisted that the integrity of society was assailed; that he was not
      sufficiently a coward to desert his post; and that it was manifestly just
      that a few should be martyred for the ultimate welfare of the many.
      Nevertheless this blood was upon his head, and he sank into deeper and
      deeper gloom. I was likewise whelmed with the guilt of an accomplice.
      Babies were ruthlessly killed, children, aged men; and not only were these
      murders local, but they were distributed over the country. In the middle
      of February, one evening, as we sat in the library, there came a sharp
      knock at the door. On responding to it I found, lying on the carpet of the
      corridor, the following missive:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. OF M., February 15, 1900.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Does not your soul cry out upon the red harvest it is
      reaping? Perhaps we have been too abstract in conducting our business. Let
      us now be concrete. Miss Adelaide Laidlaw is a talented young woman, as
      good, we understand, as she is beautiful. She is the daughter of your old
      friend, Judge Laidlaw, and we happen to know that you carried her in your
      arms when she was an infant. She is your daughter&rsquo;s closest friend, and at
      present is visiting her. When your eyes have read thus far her visit will
      have terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very cordially,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      My God! did we not instantly realize the terrible import! We rushed
      through the dayrooms&mdash;she was not there&mdash;and on to her own
      apartments. The door was locked, but we crashed it down by hurling
      ourselves against it. There she lay, just as she had finished dressing for
      the opera, smothered with pillows torn from the couch, the flush of life
      yet on her flesh, the body still flexible and warm. Let me pass over the
      rest of this horror. You will surely remember, John, the newspaper
      accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night Mr. Hale summoned me to him, and before God did pledge me
      most solemnly to stand by him and not to compromise, even if all kith and
      kin were destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I was surprised at his cheerfulness. I had thought he would
      be deeply shocked by this last tragedy&mdash;how deep I was soon to learn.
      All day he was light-hearted and high-spirited, as though at last he had
      found a way out of the frightful difficulty. The next morning we found him
      dead in his bed, a peaceful smile upon his careworn face&mdash;asphyxiation.
      Through the connivance of the police and the authorities, it was given out
      to the world as heart disease. We deemed it wise to withhold the truth;
      but little good has it done us, little good has anything done us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barely had I left that chamber of death, when&mdash;but too late&mdash;the
      following extraordinary letter was received:
    </p>
    <p>
      OFFICE OF THE M. of M., February 17, 1900.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EBEN HALE, Money Baron:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;You will pardon our intrusion, we hope, so closely upon
      the sad event of day before yesterday; but what we wish to say may be of
      the utmost importance to you. It is in our mind that you may attempt to
      escape us. There is but one way, apparently, as you have ere this
      doubtless discovered. But we wish to inform you that even this one way is
      barred. You may die, but you die failing and acknowledging your failure.
      Note this: WE ARE PART AND PARCEL OF YOUR POSSESSIONS. WITH YOUR MILLIONS
      WE PASS DOWN TO YOUR HEIRS AND ASSIGNS FOREVER.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are the inevitable. We are the culmination of industrial and social
      wrong. We turn upon the society that has created us. We are the successful
      failures of the age, the scourges of a degraded civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are the creatures of a perverse social selection. We meet force with
      force. Only the strong shall endure. We believe in the survival of the
      fittest. You have crushed your wage slaves into the dirt and you have
      survived. The captains of war, at your command, have shot down like dogs
      your employees in a score of bloody strikes. By such means you have
      endured. We do not grumble at the result, for we acknowledge and have our
      being in the same natural law. And now the question has arisen: UNDER THE
      PRESENT SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH OF US SHALL SURVIVE? We believe we are
      the fittest. You believe you are the fittest. We leave the eventuality to
      time and law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cordially yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINIONS OF MIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, do you wonder now that I shunned pleasure and avoided friends? But
      why explain? Surely this narrative will make everything clear. Three weeks
      ago Adelaide Laidlaw died. Since then I have waited in hope and fear.
      Yesterday the will was probated and made public. Today I was notified that
      a woman of the middle class would be killed in Golden Gate Park, in
      faraway San Francisco. The despatches in to-night&rsquo;s papers give the
      details of the brutal happening&mdash;details which correspond with those
      furnished me in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is useless. I cannot struggle against the inevitable. I have been
      faithful to Mr. Hale and have worked hard. Why my faithfulness should have
      been thus rewarded I cannot understand. Yet I cannot be false to my trust,
      nor break my word by compromising. Still, I have resolved that no more
      deaths shall be upon my head. I have willed the many millions I lately
      received to their rightful owners. Let the stalwart sons of Eben Hale work
      out their own salvation. Ere you read this I shall have passed on. The
      Minions of Midas are all-powerful. The police are impotent. I have learned
      from them that other millionnaires have been likewise mulcted or
      persecuted&mdash;how many is not known, for when one yields to the M. of
      M., his mouth is thenceforth sealed. Those who have not yielded are even
      now reaping their scarlet harvest. The grim game is being played out. The
      Federal Government can do nothing. I also understand that similar branch
      organizations have made their appearance in Europe. Society is shaken to
      its foundations. Principalities and powers are as brands ripe for the
      burning. Instead of the masses against the classes, it is a class against
      the classes. We, the guardians of human progress, are being singled out
      and struck down. Law and order have failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officials have begged me to keep this secret. I have done so, but can
      do so no longer. It has become a question of public import, fraught with
      the direst consequences, and I shall do my duty before I leave this world
      by informing it of its peril. Do you, John, as my last request, make this
      public. Do not be frightened. The fate of humanity rests in your hand. Let
      the press strike off millions of copies; let the electric currents sweep
      it round the world; wherever men meet and speak, let them speak of it in
      fear and trembling. And then, when thoroughly aroused, let society arise
      in its might and cast out this abomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, in long farewell,
    </p>

    <h2>
      THE SHADOW AND THE FLASH
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I look back, I realize what a peculiar friendship it was. First,
      there was Lloyd Inwood, tall, slender, and finely knit, nervous and dark.
      And then Paul Tichlorne, tall, slender, and finely knit, nervous and
      blond. Each was the replica of the other in everything except color.
      Lloyd&rsquo;s eyes were black; Paul&rsquo;s were blue. Under stress of excitement, the
      blood coursed olive in the face of Lloyd, crimson in the face of Paul. But
      outside this matter of coloring they were as like as two peas. Both were
      high-strung, prone to excessive tension and endurance, and they lived at
      concert pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a trio involved in this remarkable friendship, and the third
      was short, and fat, and chunky, and lazy, and, loath to say, it was I.
      Paul and Lloyd seemed born to rivalry with each other, and I to be
      peacemaker between them. We grew up together, the three of us, and full
      often have I received the angry blows each intended for the other. They
      were always competing, striving to outdo each other, and when entered upon
      some such struggle there was no limit either to their endeavors or
      passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This intense spirit of rivalry obtained in their studies and their games.
      If Paul memorized one canto of &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; Lloyd memorized two cantos, Paul
      came back with three, and Lloyd again with four, till each knew the whole
      poem by heart. I remember an incident that occurred at the swimming hole&mdash;an
      incident tragically significant of the life-struggle between them. The
      boys had a game of diving to the bottom of a ten-foot pool and holding on
      by submerged roots to see who could stay under the longest. Paul and Lloyd
      allowed themselves to be bantered into making the descent together. When I
      saw their faces, set and determined, disappear in the water as they sank
      swiftly down, I felt a foreboding of something dreadful. The moments sped,
      the ripples died away, the face of the pool grew placid and untroubled,
      and neither black nor golden head broke surface in quest of air. We above
      grew anxious. The longest record of the longest-winded boy had been
      exceeded, and still there was no sign. Air bubbles trickled slowly upward,
      showing that the breath had been expelled from their lungs, and after that
      the bubbles ceased to trickle upward. Each second became interminable,
      and, unable longer to endure the suspense, I plunged into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found them down at the bottom, clutching tight to the roots, their heads
      not a foot apart, their eyes wide open, each glaring fixedly at the other.
      They were suffering frightful torment, writhing and twisting in the pangs
      of voluntary suffocation; for neither would let go and acknowledge himself
      beaten. I tried to break Paul&rsquo;s hold on the root, but he resisted me
      fiercely. Then I lost my breath and came to the surface, badly scared. I
      quickly explained the situation, and half a dozen of us went down and by
      main strength tore them loose. By the time we got them out, both were
      unconscious, and it was only after much barrel-rolling and rubbing and
      pounding that they finally came to their senses. They would have drowned
      there, had no one rescued them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Paul Tichlorne entered college, he let it be generally understood
      that he was going in for the social sciences. Lloyd Inwood, entering at
      the same time, elected to take the same course. But Paul had had it
      secretly in mind all the time to study the natural sciences, specializing
      on chemistry, and at the last moment he switched over. Though Lloyd had
      already arranged his year&rsquo;s work and attended the first lectures, he at
      once followed Paul&rsquo;s lead and went in for the natural sciences and
      especially for chemistry. Their rivalry soon became a noted thing
      throughout the university. Each was a spur to the other, and they went
      into chemistry deeper than did ever students before&mdash;so deep, in
      fact, that ere they took their sheepskins they could have stumped any
      chemistry or &ldquo;cow college&rdquo; professor in the institution, save &ldquo;old&rdquo; Moss,
      head of the department, and even him they puzzled and edified more than
      once. Lloyd&rsquo;s discovery of the &ldquo;death bacillus&rdquo; of the sea toad, and his
      experiments on it with potassium cyanide, sent his name and that of his
      university ringing round the world; nor was Paul a whit behind when he
      succeeded in producing laboratory colloids exhibiting amoeba-like
      activities, and when he cast new light upon the processes of fertilization
      through his startling experiments with simple sodium chlorides and
      magnesium solutions on low forms of marine life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in their undergraduate days, however, in the midst of their
      profoundest plunges into the mysteries of organic chemistry, that Doris
      Van Benschoten entered into their lives. Lloyd met her first, but within
      twenty-four hours Paul saw to it that he also made her acquaintance. Of
      course, they fell in love with her, and she became the only thing in life
      worth living for. They wooed her with equal ardor and fire, and so intense
      became their struggle for her that half the student-body took to wagering
      wildly on the result. Even &ldquo;old&rdquo; Moss, one day, after an astounding
      demonstration in his private laboratory by Paul, was guilty to the extent
      of a month&rsquo;s salary of backing him to become the bridegroom of Doris Van
      Benschoten.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end she solved the problem in her own way, to everybody&rsquo;s
      satisfaction except Paul&rsquo;s and Lloyd&rsquo;s. Getting them together, she said
      that she really could not choose between them because she loved them both
      equally well; and that, unfortunately, since polyandry was not permitted
      in the United States she would be compelled to forego the honor and
      happiness of marrying either of them. Each blamed the other for this
      lamentable outcome, and the bitterness between them grew more bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things came to a head enough. It was at my home, after they had taken
      their degrees and dropped out of the world&rsquo;s sight, that the beginning of
      the end came to pass. Both were men of means, with little inclination and
      no necessity for professional life. My friendship and their mutual
      animosity were the two things that linked them in any way together. While
      they were very often at my place, they made it a fastidious point to avoid
      each other on such visits, though it was inevitable, under the
      circumstances, that they should come upon each other occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day I have in recollection, Paul Tichlorne had been mooning all
      morning in my study over a current scientific review. This left me free to
      my own affairs, and I was out among my roses when Lloyd Inwood arrived.
      Clipping and pruning and tacking the climbers on the porch, with my mouth
      full of nails, and Lloyd following me about and lending a hand now and
      again, we fell to discussing the mythical race of invisible people, that
      strange and vagrant people the traditions of which have come down to us.
      Lloyd warmed to the talk in his nervous, jerky fashion, and was soon
      interrogating the physical properties and possibilities of invisibility. A
      perfectly black object, he contended, would elude and defy the acutest
      vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Color is a sensation,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;It has no objective reality.
      Without light, we can see neither colors nor objects themselves. All
      objects are black in the dark, and in the dark it is impossible to see
      them. If no light strikes upon them, then no light is flung back from them
      to the eye, and so we have no vision-evidence of their being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we see black objects in daylight,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; he went on warmly. &ldquo;And that is because they are not
      perfectly black. Were they perfectly black, absolutely black, as it were,
      we could not see them&mdash;ay, not in the blaze of a thousand suns could
      we see them! And so I say, with the right pigments, properly compounded,
      an absolutely black paint could be produced which would render invisible
      whatever it was applied to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a remarkable discovery,&rdquo; I said non-committally, for the
      whole thing seemed too fantastic for aught but speculative purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable!&rdquo; Lloyd slapped me on the shoulder. &ldquo;I should say so. Why, old
      chap, to coat myself with such a paint would be to put the world at my
      feet. The secrets of kings and courts would be mine, the machinations of
      diplomats and politicians, the play of stock-gamblers, the plans of trusts
      and corporations. I could keep my hand on the inner pulse of things and
      become the greatest power in the world. And I&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
      shortly, then added, &ldquo;Well, I have begun my experiments, and I don&rsquo;t mind
      telling you that I&rsquo;m right in line for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A laugh from the doorway startled us. Paul Tichlorne was standing there, a
      smile of mockery on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, my dear Lloyd,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; Paul went on&mdash;&ldquo;ah, you forget the shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw Lloyd&rsquo;s face drop, but he answered sneeringly, &ldquo;I can carry a
      sunshade, you know.&rdquo; Then he turned suddenly and fiercely upon him. &ldquo;Look
      here, Paul, you&rsquo;ll keep out of this if you know what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rupture seemed imminent, but Paul laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      lay fingers on your dirty pigments. Succeed beyond your most sanguine
      expectations, yet you will always fetch up against the shadow. You can&rsquo;t
      get away from it. Now I shall go on the very opposite tack. In the very
      nature of my proposition the shadow will be eliminated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transparency!&rdquo; ejaculated Lloyd, instantly. &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be achieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; of course not.&rdquo; And Paul shrugged his shoulders and strolled off
      down the briar-rose path.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of it. Both men attacked the problem with all the
      tremendous energy for which they were noted, and with a rancor and
      bitterness that made me tremble for the success of either. Each trusted me
      to the utmost, and in the long weeks of experimentation that followed I
      was made a party to both sides, listening to their theorizings and
      witnessing their demonstrations. Never, by word or sign, did I convey to
      either the slightest hint of the other&rsquo;s progress, and they respected me
      for the seal I put upon my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lloyd Inwood, after prolonged and unintermittent application, when the
      tension upon his mind and body became too great to bear, had a strange way
      of obtaining relief. He attended prize fights. It was at one of these
      brutal exhibitions, whither he had dragged me in order to tell his latest
      results, that his theory received striking confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that red-whiskered man?&rdquo; he asked, pointing across the ring to
      the fifth tier of seats on the opposite side. &ldquo;And do you see the next man
      to him, the one in the white hat? Well, there is quite a gap between them,
      is there not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;They are a seat apart. The gap is the unoccupied
      seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over to me and spoke seriously. &ldquo;Between the red-whiskered man
      and the white-hatted man sits Ben Wasson. You have heard me speak of him.
      He is the cleverest pugilist of his weight in the country. He is also a
      Caribbean negro, full-blooded, and the blackest in the United States. He
      has on a black overcoat buttoned up. I saw him when he came in and took
      that seat. As soon as he sat down he disappeared. Watch closely; he may
      smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was for crossing over to verify Lloyd&rsquo;s statement, but he restrained me.
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited and watched, till the red-whiskered man turned his head as though
      addressing the unoccupied seat; and then, in that empty space, I saw the
      rolling whites of a pair of eyes and the white double-crescent of two rows
      of teeth, and for the instant I could make out a negro&rsquo;s face. But with
      the passing of the smile his visibility passed, and the chair seemed
      vacant as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were he perfectly black, you could sit alongside him and not see him,&rdquo;
       Lloyd said; and I confess the illustration was apt enough to make me
      well-nigh convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I visited Lloyd&rsquo;s laboratory a number of times after that, and found him
      always deep in his search after the absolute black. His experiments
      covered all sorts of pigments, such as lamp-blacks, tars, carbonized
      vegetable matters, soots of oils and fats, and the various carbonized
      animal substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White light is composed of the seven primary colors,&rdquo; he argued to me.
      &ldquo;But it is itself, of itself, invisible. Only by being reflected from
      objects do it and the objects become visible. But only that portion of it
      that is reflected becomes visible. For instance, here is a blue
      tobacco-box. The white light strikes against it, and, with one exception,
      all its component colors&mdash;violet, indigo, green, yellow, orange, and
      red&mdash;are absorbed. The one exception is BLUE. It is not absorbed, but
      reflected. Wherefore the tobacco-box gives us a sensation of blueness. We
      do not see the other colors because they are absorbed. We see only the
      blue. For the same reason grass is GREEN. The green waves of white light
      are thrown upon our eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we paint our houses, we do not apply color to them,&rdquo; he said at
      another time. &ldquo;What we do is to apply certain substances that have the
      property of absorbing from white light all the colors except those that we
      would have our houses appear. When a substance reflects all the colors to
      the eye, it seems to us white. When it absorbs all the colors, it is
      black. But, as I said before, we have as yet no perfect black. All the
      colors are not absorbed. The perfect black, guarding against high lights,
      will be utterly and absolutely invisible. Look at that, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the palette lying on his work-table. Different shades of
      black pigments were brushed on it. One, in particular, I could hardly see.
      It gave my eyes a blurring sensation, and I rubbed them and looked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;is the blackest black you or any mortal man
      ever looked upon. But just you wait, and I&rsquo;ll have a black so black that
      no mortal man will be able to look upon it&mdash;and see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I used to find Paul Tichlorne plunged as deeply into
      the study of light polarization, diffraction, and interference, single and
      double refraction, and all manner of strange organic compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Transparency: a state or quality of body which permits all rays of light
      to pass through,&rdquo; he defined for me. &ldquo;That is what I am seeking. Lloyd
      blunders up against the shadow with his perfect opaqueness. But I escape
      it. A transparent body casts no shadow; neither does it reflect
      light-waves&mdash;that is, the perfectly transparent does not. So,
      avoiding high lights, not only will such a body cast no shadow, but, since
      it reflects no light, it will also be invisible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were standing by the window at another time. Paul was engaged in
      polishing a number of lenses, which were ranged along the sill. Suddenly,
      after a pause in the conversation, he said, &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve dropped a lens.
      Stick your head out, old man, and see where it went to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out I started to thrust my head, but a sharp blow on the forehead caused
      me to recoil. I rubbed my bruised brow and gazed with reproachful inquiry
      at Paul, who was laughing in gleeful, boyish fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you investigate?&rdquo; he demanded. And investigate I did. Before
      thrusting out my head, my senses, automatically active, had told me there
      was nothing there, that nothing intervened between me and out-of-doors,
      that the aperture of the window opening was utterly empty. I stretched
      forth my hand and felt a hard object, smooth and cool and flat, which my
      touch, out of its experience, told me to be glass. I looked again, but
      could see positively nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White quartzose sand,&rdquo; Paul rattled off, &ldquo;sodic carbonate, slaked lime,
      cutlet, manganese peroxide&mdash;there you have it, the finest French
      plate glass, made by the great St. Gobain Company, who made the finest
      plate glass in the world, and this is the finest piece they ever made. It
      cost a king&rsquo;s ransom. But look at it! You can&rsquo;t see it. You don&rsquo;t know
      it&rsquo;s there till you run your head against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, old boy! That&rsquo;s merely an object-lesson&mdash;certain elements, in
      themselves opaque, yet so compounded as to give a resultant body which is
      transparent. But that is a matter of inorganic chemistry, you say. Very
      true. But I dare to assert, standing here on my two feet, that in the
      organic I can duplicate whatever occurs in the inorganic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He held a test-tube between me and the light, and I noted the
      cloudy or muddy liquid it contained. He emptied the contents of another
      test-tube into it, and almost instantly it became clear and sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or here!&rdquo; With quick, nervous movements among his array of test-tubes, he
      turned a white solution to a wine color, and a light yellow solution to a
      dark brown. He dropped a piece of litmus paper into an acid, when it
      changed instantly to red, and on floating it in an alkali it turned as
      quickly to blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The litmus paper is still the litmus paper,&rdquo; he enunciated in the formal
      manner of the lecturer. &ldquo;I have not changed it into something else. Then
      what did I do? I merely changed the arrangement of its molecules. Where,
      at first, it absorbed all colors from the light but red, its molecular
      structure was so changed that it absorbed red and all colors except blue.
      And so it goes, ad infinitum. Now, what I purpose to do is this.&rdquo; He
      paused for a space. &ldquo;I purpose to seek&mdash;ay, and to find&mdash;the
      proper reagents, which, acting upon the living organism, will bring about
      molecular changes analogous to those you have just witnessed. But these
      reagents, which I shall find, and for that matter, upon which I already
      have my hands, will not turn the living body to blue or red or black, but
      they will turn it to transparency. All light will pass through it. It will
      be invisible. It will cast no shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks later I went hunting with Paul. He had been promising me for
      some time that I should have the pleasure of shooting over a wonderful dog&mdash;the
      most wonderful dog, in fact, that ever man shot over, so he averred, and
      continued to aver till my curiosity was aroused. But on the morning in
      question I was disappointed, for there was no dog in evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see him about,&rdquo; Paul remarked unconcernedly, and we set off across
      the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not imagine, at the time, what was ailing me, but I had a feeling
      of some impending and deadly illness. My nerves were all awry, and, from
      the astounding tricks they played me, my senses seemed to have run riot.
      Strange sounds disturbed me. At times I heard the swish-swish of grass
      being shoved aside, and once the patter of feet across a patch of stony
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear anything, Paul?&rdquo; I asked once.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he shook his head, and thrust his feet steadily forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      While climbing a fence, I heard the low, eager whine of a dog, apparently
      from within a couple of feet of me; but on looking about me I saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped to the ground, limp and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we had better return to the house. I am afraid I am going
      to be sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, old man,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The sunshine has gone to your head like
      wine. You&rsquo;ll be all right. It&rsquo;s famous weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, passing along a narrow path through a clump of cottonwoods, some
      object brushed against my legs and I stumbled and nearly fell. I looked
      with sudden anxiety at Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tripping over your own feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I kept my tongue between my teeth and plodded on, though sore perplexed
      and thoroughly satisfied that some acute and mysterious malady had
      attacked my nerves. So far my eyes had escaped; but, when we got to the
      open fields again, even my vision went back on me. Strange flashes of
      vari-colored, rainbow light began to appear and disappear on the path
      before me. Still, I managed to keep myself in hand, till the vari-colored
      lights persisted for a space of fully twenty seconds, dancing and flashing
      in continuous play. Then I sat down, weak and shaky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up with me,&rdquo; I gasped, covering my eyes with my hands. &ldquo;It has
      attacked my eyes. Paul, take me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Paul laughed long and loud. &ldquo;What did I tell you?&mdash;the most
      wonderful dog, eh? Well, what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned partly from me and began to whistle. I heard the patter of feet,
      the panting of a heated animal, and the unmistakable yelp of a dog. Then
      Paul stooped down and apparently fondled the empty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Give me your fist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he rubbed my hand over the cold nose and jowls of a dog. A dog it
      certainly was, with the shape and the smooth, short coat of a pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffice to say, I speedily recovered my spirits and control. Paul put a
      collar about the animal&rsquo;s neck and tied his handkerchief to its tail. And
      then was vouchsafed us the remarkable sight of an empty collar and a
      waving handkerchief cavorting over the fields. It was something to see
      that collar and handkerchief pin a bevy of quail in a clump of locusts and
      remain rigid and immovable till we had flushed the birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again the dog emitted the vari-colored light-flashes I have
      mentioned. The one thing, Paul explained, which he had not anticipated and
      which he doubted could be overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a large family,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these sun dogs, wind dogs, rainbows,
      halos, and parhelia. They are produced by refraction of light from mineral
      and ice crystals, from mist, rain, spray, and no end of things; and I am
      afraid they are the penalty I must pay for transparency. I escaped Lloyd&rsquo;s
      shadow only to fetch up against the rainbow flash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days later, before the entrance to Paul&rsquo;s laboratory, I
      encountered a terrible stench. So overpowering was it that it was easy to
      discover the source&mdash;a mass of putrescent matter on the doorstep
      which in general outlines resembled a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul was startled when he investigated my find. It was his invisible dog,
      or rather, what had been his invisible dog, for it was now plainly
      visible. It had been playing about but a few minutes before in all health
      and strength. Closer examination revealed that the skull had been crushed
      by some heavy blow. While it was strange that the animal should have been
      killed, the inexplicable thing was that it should so quickly decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reagents I injected into its system were harmless,&rdquo; Paul explained.
      &ldquo;Yet they were powerful, and it appears that when death comes they force
      practically instantaneous disintegration. Remarkable! Most remarkable!
      Well, the only thing is not to die. They do not harm so long as one lives.
      But I do wonder who smashed in that dog&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Light, however, was thrown upon this when a frightened housemaid brought
      the news that Gaffer Bedshaw had that very morning, not more than an hour
      back, gone violently insane, and was strapped down at home, in the
      huntsman&rsquo;s lodge, where he raved of a battle with a ferocious and gigantic
      beast that he had encountered in the Tichlorne pasture. He claimed that
      the thing, whatever it was, was invisible, that with his own eyes he had
      seen that it was invisible; wherefore his tearful wife and daughters shook
      their heads, and wherefore he but waxed the more violent, and the gardener
      and the coachman tightened the straps by another hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, while Paul Tichlorne was thus successfully mastering the problem of
      invisibility, was Lloyd Inwood a whit behind. I went over in answer to a
      message of his to come and see how he was getting on. Now his laboratory
      occupied an isolated situation in the midst of his vast grounds. It was
      built in a pleasant little glade, surrounded on all sides by a dense
      forest growth, and was to be gained by way of a winding and erratic path.
      But I have travelled that path so often as to know every foot of it, and
      conceive my surprise when I came upon the glade and found no laboratory.
      The quaint shed structure with its red sandstone chimney was not. Nor did
      it look as if it ever had been. There were no signs of ruin, no debris,
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started to walk across what had once been its site. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; I said to
      myself, &ldquo;should be where the step went up to the door.&rdquo; Barely were the
      words out of my mouth when I stubbed my toe on some obstacle, pitched
      forward, and butted my head into something that FELT very much like a
      door. I reached out my hand. It WAS a door. I found the knob and turned
      it. And at once, as the door swung inward on its hinges, the whole
      interior of the laboratory impinged upon my vision. Greeting Lloyd, I
      closed the door and backed up the path a few paces. I could see nothing of
      the building. Returning and opening the door, at once all the furniture
      and every detail of the interior were visible. It was indeed startling,
      the sudden transition from void to light and form and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it, eh?&rdquo; Lloyd asked, wringing my hand. &ldquo;I slapped a
      couple of coats of absolute black on the outside yesterday afternoon to
      see how it worked. How&rsquo;s your head? you bumped it pretty solidly, I
      imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; he interrupted my congratulations. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something
      better for you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he talked he began to strip, and when he stood naked before me he
      thrust a pot and brush into my hand and said, &ldquo;Here, give me a coat of
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an oily, shellac-like stuff, which spread quickly and easily over
      the skin and dried immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely preliminary and precautionary,&rdquo; he explained when I had finished;
      &ldquo;but now for the real stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I picked up another pot he indicated, and glanced inside, but could see
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stick your finger in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed, and was aware of a sensation of cool moistness. On withdrawing
      my hand I glanced at the forefinger, the one I had immersed, but it had
      disappeared. I moved and knew from the alternate tension and relaxation of
      the muscles that I moved it, but it defied my sense of sight. To all
      appearances I had been shorn of a finger; nor could I get any visual
      impression of it till I extended it under the skylight and saw its shadow
      plainly blotted on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lloyd chuckled. &ldquo;Now spread it on, and keep your eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dipped the brush into the seemingly empty pot, and gave him a long
      stroke across his chest. With the passage of the brush the living flesh
      disappeared from beneath. I covered his right leg, and he was a one-legged
      man defying all laws of gravitation. And so, stroke by stroke, member by
      member, I painted Lloyd Inwood into nothingness. It was a creepy
      experience, and I was glad when naught remained in sight but his burning
      black eyes, poised apparently unsupported in mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a refined and harmless solution for them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A fine spray
      with an air-brush, and presto! I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This deftly accomplished, he said, &ldquo;Now I shall move about, and do you
      tell me what sensations you experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I cannot see you,&rdquo; I said, and I could hear his
      gleeful laugh from the midst of the emptiness. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I continued,
      &ldquo;you cannot escape your shadow, but that was to be expected. When you pass
      between my eye and an object, the object disappears, but so unusual and
      incomprehensible is its disappearance that it seems to me as though my
      eyes had blurred. When you move rapidly, I experience a bewildering
      succession of blurs. The blurring sensation makes my eyes ache and my
      brain tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any other warnings of my presence?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;When you are near me I have feelings similar
      to those produced by dank warehouses, gloomy crypts, and deep mines. And
      as sailors feel the loom of the land on dark nights, so I think I feel the
      loom of your body. But it is all very vague and intangible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long we talked that last morning in his laboratory; and when I turned to
      go, he put his unseen hand in mine with nervous grip, and said, &ldquo;Now I
      shall conquer the world!&rdquo; And I could not dare to tell him of Paul
      Tichlorne&rsquo;s equal success.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home I found a note from Paul, asking me to come up immediately, and it
      was high noon when I came spinning up the driveway on my wheel. Paul
      called me from the tennis court, and I dismounted and went over. But the
      court was empty. As I stood there, gaping open-mouthed, a tennis ball
      struck me on the arm, and as I turned about, another whizzed past my ear.
      For aught I could see of my assailant, they came whirling at me from out
      of space, and right well was I peppered with them. But when the balls
      already flung at me began to come back for a second whack, I realized the
      situation. Seizing a racquet and keeping my eyes open, I quickly saw a
      rainbow flash appearing and disappearing and darting over the ground. I
      took out after it, and when I laid the racquet upon it for a half-dozen
      stout blows, Paul&rsquo;s voice rang out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! Enough! Oh! Ouch! Stop! You&rsquo;re landing on my naked skin, you
      know! Ow! O-w-w! I&rsquo;ll be good! I&rsquo;ll be good! I only wanted you to see my
      metamorphosis,&rdquo; he said ruefully, and I imagined he was rubbing his hurts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later we were playing tennis&mdash;a handicap on my part,
      for I could have no knowledge of his position save when all the angles
      between himself, the sun, and me, were in proper conjunction. Then he
      flashed, and only then. But the flashes were more brilliant than the
      rainbow&mdash;purest blue, most delicate violet, brightest yellow, and all
      the intermediary shades, with the scintillant brilliancy of the diamond,
      dazzling, blinding, iridescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the midst of our play I felt a sudden cold chill, reminding me of
      deep mines and gloomy crypts, such a chill as I had experienced that very
      morning. The next moment, close to the net, I saw a ball rebound in
      mid-air and empty space, and at the same instant, a score of feet away,
      Paul Tichlorne emitted a rainbow flash. It could not be he from whom the
      ball had rebounded, and with sickening dread I realized that Lloyd Inwood
      had come upon the scene. To make sure, I looked for his shadow, and there
      it was, a shapeless blotch the girth of his body, (the sun was overhead),
      moving along the ground. I remembered his threat, and felt sure that all
      the long years of rivalry were about to culminate in uncanny battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cried a warning to Paul, and heard a snarl as of a wild beast, and an
      answering snarl. I saw the dark blotch move swiftly across the court, and
      a brilliant burst of vari-colored light moving with equal swiftness to
      meet it; and then shadow and flash came together and there was the sound
      of unseen blows. The net went down before my frightened eyes. I sprang
      toward the fighters, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But their locked bodies smote against my knees, and I was overthrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep out of this, old man!&rdquo; I heard the voice of Lloyd Inwood from
      out of the emptiness. And then Paul&rsquo;s voice crying, &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve had enough
      of peacemaking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the sound of their voices I knew they had separated. I could not
      locate Paul, and so approached the shadow that represented Lloyd. But from
      the other side came a stunning blow on the point of my jaw, and I heard
      Paul scream angrily, &ldquo;Now will you keep away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they came together again, the impact of their blows, their groans and
      gasps, and the swift flashings and shadow-movings telling plainly of the
      deadliness of the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouted for help, and Gaffer Bedshaw came running into the court. I
      could see, as he approached, that he was looking at me strangely, but he
      collided with the combatants and was hurled headlong to the ground. With
      despairing shriek and a cry of &ldquo;O Lord, I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em!&rdquo; he sprang to his
      feet and tore madly out of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could do nothing, so I sat up, fascinated and powerless, and watched the
      struggle. The noonday sun beat down with dazzling brightness on the naked
      tennis court. And it was naked. All I could see was the blotch of shadow
      and the rainbow flashes, the dust rising from the invisible feet, the
      earth tearing up from beneath the straining foot-grips, and the wire
      screen bulge once or twice as their bodies hurled against it. That was
      all, and after a time even that ceased. There were no more flashes, and
      the shadow had become long and stationary; and I remembered their set
      boyish faces when they clung to the roots in the deep coolness of the
      pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found me an hour afterward. Some inkling of what had happened got to
      the servants and they quitted the Tichlorne service in a body. Gaffer
      Bedshaw never recovered from the second shock he received, and is confined
      in a madhouse, hopelessly incurable. The secrets of their marvellous
      discoveries died with Paul and Lloyd, both laboratories being destroyed by
      grief-stricken relatives. As for myself, I no longer care for chemical
      research, and science is a tabooed topic in my household. I have returned
      to my roses. Nature&rsquo;s colors are good enough for me.

    <h2>
      ALL GOLD CANYON
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the green heart of the canyon, where the walls swerved back from
      the rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little
      sheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness and
      softness. Here all things rested. Even the narrow stream ceased its
      turbulent down-rush long enough to form a quiet pool. Knee-deep in the
      water, with drooping head and half-shut eyes, drowsed a red-coated,
      many-antlered buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side, beginning at the very lip of the pool, was a tiny meadow, a
      cool, resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the frowning
      wall. Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the
      opposing wall. Fine grass covered the slope&mdash;grass that was spangled
      with flowers, with here and there patches of color, orange and purple and
      golden. Below, the canyon was shut in. There was no view. The walls leaned
      together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks, moss-covered
      and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees. Up
      the canyon rose far hills and peaks, the big foothills, pine-covered and
      remote. And far beyond, like clouds upon the border of the slay, towered
      minarets of white, where the Sierra&rsquo;s eternal snows flashed austerely the
      blazes of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no dust in the canyon. The leaves and flowers were clean and
      virginal. The grass was young velvet. Over the pool three cottonwoods sent
      their scurvy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air. On the slope the
      blossoms of the wine-wooded manzanita filled the air with springtime
      odors, while the leaves, wise with experience, were already beginning
      their vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer. In the open
      spaces on the slope, beyond the farthest shadow-reach of the manzanita,
      poised the mariposa lilies, like so many flights of jewelled moths
      suddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again. Here
      and there that woods harlequin, the madrone, permitting itself to be
      caught in the act of changing its pea-green trunk to madder-red, breathed
      its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells. Creamy
      white were these bells, shaped like lilies-of-the-valley, with the
      sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a sigh of wind. The air was drowsy with its weight of
      perfume. It was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air been
      heavy and humid. But the air was sharp and thin. It was as starlight
      transmuted into atmosphere, shot through and warmed by sunshine, and
      flower-drenched with sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light
      and shade. And from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain bees&mdash;feasting
      Sybarites that jostled one another good-naturedly at the board, nor found
      time for rough discourtesy. So quietly did the little stream drip and
      ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in faint and
      occasional gurgles. The voice of the stream was as a drowsy whisper, ever
      interrupted by dozings and silences, ever lifted again in the awakenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon.
      Sunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees. The hum of
      the bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound. And the
      drifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making
      of a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place. It
      was a spirit of peace that was not of death, but of smooth-pulsing life,
      of quietude that was not silence, of movement that was not action, of
      repose that was quick with existence without being violent with struggle
      and travail. The spirit of the place was the spirit of the peace of the
      living, somnolent with the easement and content of prosperity, and
      undisturbed by rumors of far wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-coated, many-antlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the spirit
      of the place and dozed knee-deep in the cool, shaded pool. There seemed no
      flies to vex him and he was languid with rest. Sometimes his ears moved
      when the stream awoke and whispered; but they moved lazily, with,
      foreknowledge that it was merely the stream grown garrulous at discovery
      that it had slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there came a time when the buck&rsquo;s ears lifted and tensed with swift
      eagerness for sound. His head was turned down the canyon. His sensitive,
      quivering nostrils scented the air. His eyes could not pierce the green
      screen through which the stream rippled away, but to his ears came the
      voice of a man. It was a steady, monotonous, singsong voice. Once the buck
      heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock. At the sound he snorted with a
      sudden start that jerked him through the air from water to meadow, and his
      feet sank into the young velvet, while he pricked his ears and again
      scented the air. Then he stole across the tiny meadow, pausing once and
      again to listen, and faded away out of the canyon like a wraith,
      soft-footed and without sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clash of steel-shod soles against the rocks began to be heard, and the
      man&rsquo;s voice grew louder. It was raised in a sort of chant and became
      distinct with nearness, so that the words could be heard:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Turn around an&rsquo; tu&rsquo;n yo&rsquo; face
    Untoe them sweet hills of grace
      (D&rsquo; pow&rsquo;rs of sin yo&rsquo; am scornin&rsquo;!).
    Look about an&rsquo; look aroun&rsquo;,
    Fling yo&rsquo; sin-pack on d&rsquo; groun&rsquo; 
      (Yo&rsquo; will meet wid d&rsquo; Lord in d&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;!).&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A sound of scrambling accompanied the song, and the spirit of the place
      fled away on the heels of the red-coated buck. The green screen was burst
      asunder, and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the sloping
      side-hill. He was a deliberate sort of man. He took in the scene with one
      embracing glance, then ran his eyes over the details to verify the general
      impression. Then, and not until then, did he open his mouth in vivid and
      solemn approval:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoke of life an&rsquo; snakes of purgatory! Will you just look at that! Wood
      an&rsquo; water an&rsquo; grass an&rsquo; a side-hill! A pocket-hunter&rsquo;s delight an&rsquo; a
      cayuse&rsquo;s paradise! Cool green for tired eyes! Pink pills for pale people
      ain&rsquo;t in it. A secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for
      tired burros, by damn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a sandy-complexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed
      the salient characteristics. It was a mobile face, quick-changing to
      inward mood and thought. Thinking was in him a visible process. Ideas
      chased across his face like wind-flaws across the surface of a lake. His
      hair, sparse and unkempt of growth, was as indeterminate and colorless as
      his complexion. It would seem that all the color of his frame had gone
      into his eyes, for they were startlingly blue. Also, they were laughing
      and merry eyes, within them much of the naivete and wonder of the child;
      and yet, in an unassertive way, they contained much of calm self-reliance
      and strength of purpose founded upon self-experience and experience of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      From out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miner&rsquo;s
      pick and shovel and gold-pan. Then he crawled out himself into the open.
      He was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt, with hobnailed
      brogans on his feet, and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains
      advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and camp-smoke. He
      stood erect, seeing wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously
      inhaling the warm, sweet breath of the canyon-garden through nostrils that
      dilated and quivered with delight. His eyes narrowed to laughing slits of
      blue, his face wreathed itself in joy, and his mouth curled in a smile as
      he cried aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks, but that smells good to me! Talk
      about your attar o&rsquo; roses an&rsquo; cologne factories! They ain&rsquo;t in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the habit of soliloquy. His quick-changing facial expressions might
      tell every thought and mood, but the tongue, perforce, ran hard after,
      repeating, like a second Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its
      water. &ldquo;Tastes good to me,&rdquo; he murmured, lifting his head and gazing
      across the pool at the side-hill, while he wiped his mouth with the back
      of his hand. The side-hill attracted his attention. Still lying on his
      stomach, he studied the hill formation long and carefully. It was a
      practised eye that travelled up the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall and
      back and down again to the edge of the pool. He scrambled to his feet and
      favored the side-hill with a second survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks good to me,&rdquo; he concluded, picking up his pick and shovel and
      gold-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the stream below the pool, stepping agilely from stone to
      stone. Where the sidehill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of dirt
      and put it into the gold-pan. He squatted down, holding the pan in his two
      hands, and partly immersing it in the stream. Then he imparted to the pan
      a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and out through the
      dirt and gravel. The larger and the lighter particles worked to the
      surface, and these, by a skilful dipping movement of the pan, he spilled
      out and over the edge. Occasionally, to expedite matters, he rested the
      pan and with his fingers raked out the large pebbles and pieces of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the
      smallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very
      deliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and
      finer, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last the
      pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick semicircular
      flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream, he
      disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan. So thin was this
      layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined it closely. In the
      midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a little water in over
      the depressed edge of the pan. With a quick flirt he sent the water
      sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains of black sand over and
      over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The washing had now become very fine&mdash;fine beyond all need of
      ordinary placer-mining. He worked the black sand, a small portion at a
      time, up the shallow rim of the pan. Each small portion he examined
      sharply, so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to
      slide over the edge and away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand
      slip away. A golden speck, no larger than a pin-point, appeared on the
      rim, and by his manipulation of the riveter it returned to the bottom of
      the pan. And in such fashion another speck was disclosed, and another.
      Great was his care of them. Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden
      specks so that not one should be lost. At last, of the pan of dirt nothing
      remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and then, after all his
      labor, sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet.
      &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; he muttered aloud, asserting the sum of the specks for which he
      had toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away. &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; he
      repeated, with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still a long while, surveying the hill-side. In his eyes was a
      curiosity, new-aroused and burning. There was an exultance about his
      bearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh
      scent of game.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again came the careful washing, the jealous herding of the golden specks,
      and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the stream when he
      had counted their number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five,&rdquo; he muttered, and repeated, &ldquo;five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan
      farther down the stream. His golden herds diminished. &ldquo;Four, three, two,
      two, one,&rdquo; were his memory-tabulations as he moved down the stream. When
      but one speck of gold rewarded his washing, he stopped and built a fire of
      dry twigs. Into this he thrust the gold-pan and burned it till it was
      blue-black. He held up the pan and examined it critically. Then he nodded
      approbation. Against such a color-background he could defy the tiniest
      yellow speck to elude him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still moving down the stream, he panned again. A single speck was his
      reward. A third pan contained no gold at all. Not satisfied with this, he
      panned three times again, taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of one
      another. Each pan proved empty of gold, and the fact, instead of
      discouraging him, seemed to give him satisfaction. His elation increased
      with each barren washing, until he arose, exclaiming jubilantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t the real thing, may God knock off my head with sour apples!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Returning to where he had started operations, he began to pan up the
      stream. At first his golden herds increased&mdash;increased prodigiously.
      &ldquo;Fourteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-six,&rdquo; ran his memory tabulations.
      Just above the pool he struck his richest pan&mdash;thirty-five colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost enough to save,&rdquo; he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water
      to sweep them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun climbed to the top of the sky. The man worked on. Pan by pan, he
      went up the stream, the tally of results steadily decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just booful, the way it peters out,&rdquo; he exulted when a shovelful of
      dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when no specks at all were found in several pans, he straightened up
      and favored the hillside with a confident glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! Mr. Pocket!&rdquo; he cried out, as though to an auditor hidden
      somewhere above him beneath the surface of the slope. &ldquo;Ah, ha! Mr. Pocket!
      I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m shorely gwine to get yer! You heah me,
      Mr. Pocket? I&rsquo;m gwine to get yer as shore as punkins ain&rsquo;t cauliflowers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in the
      azure of the cloudless sky. Then he went down the canyon, following the
      line of shovel-holes he had made in filling the pans. He crossed the
      stream below the pool and disappeared through the green screen. There was
      little opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its quietude
      and repose, for the man&rsquo;s voice, raised in ragtime song, still dominated
      the canyon with possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, with a greater clashing of steel-shod feet on rock, he
      returned. The green screen was tremendously agitated. It surged back and
      forth in the throes of a struggle. There was a loud grating and clanging
      of metal. The man&rsquo;s voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with
      imperativeness. A large body plunged and panted. There was a snapping and
      ripping and rending, and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst
      through the screen. On its back was a pack, and from this trailed broken
      vines and torn creepers. The animal gazed with astonished eyes at the
      scene into which it had been precipitated, then dropped its head to the
      grass and began contentedly to graze. A second horse scrambled into view,
      slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs
      sank into the yielding surface of the meadow. It was riderless, though on
      its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle, scarred and discolored by long
      usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man brought up the rear. He threw off pack and saddle, with an eye to
      camp location, and gave the animals their freedom to graze. He unpacked
      his food and got out frying-pan and coffee-pot. He gathered an armful of
      dry wood, and with a few stones made a place for his fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got an appetite. I could scoff iron-filings an&rsquo; 
      horseshoe nails an&rsquo; thank you kindly, ma&rsquo;am, for a second helpin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened up, and, while he reached for matches in the pocket of his
      overalls, his eyes travelled across the pool to the side-hill. His fingers
      had clutched the match-box, but they relaxed their hold and the hand came
      out empty. The man wavered perceptibly. He looked at his preparations for
      cooking and he looked at the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll take another whack at her,&rdquo; he concluded, starting to cross
      the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t no sense in it, I know,&rdquo; he mumbled apologetically. &ldquo;But
      keepin&rsquo; grub back an hour ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to hurt none, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few feet back from his first line of test-pans he started a second line.
      The sun dropped down the western sky, the shadows lengthened, but the man
      worked on. He began a third line of test-pans. He was cross-cutting the
      hillside, line by line, as he ascended. The centre of each line produced
      the richest pans, while the ends came where no colors showed in the pan.
      And as he ascended the hillside the lines grew perceptibly shorter. The
      regularity with which their length diminished served to indicate that
      somewhere up the slope the last line would be so short as to have scarcely
      length at all, and that beyond could come only a point. The design was
      growing into an inverted &ldquo;V.&rdquo; The converging sides of this &ldquo;V&rdquo; marked the
      boundaries of the gold-bearing dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apex of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; was evidently the man&rsquo;s goal. Often he ran his eye
      along the converging sides and on up the hill, trying to divine the apex,
      the point where the gold-bearing dirt must cease. Here resided &ldquo;Mr.
      Pocket&rdquo;&mdash;for so the man familiarly addressed the imaginary point
      above him on the slope, crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down out o&rsquo; that, Mr. Pocket! Be right smart an&rsquo; agreeable, an&rsquo; come
      down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he would add later, in a voice resigned to determination.
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Pocket. It&rsquo;s plain to me I got to come right up an&rsquo; snatch
      you out bald-headed. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do it! I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; he would threaten still
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each pan he carried down to the water to wash, and as he went higher up
      the hill the pans grew richer, until he began to save the gold in an empty
      baking-powder can which he carried carelessly in his hip-pocket. So
      engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of
      oncoming night. It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in
      the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time. He
      straightened up abruptly. An expression of whimsical wonderment and awe
      overspread his face as he drawled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh darn my buttons! if I didn&rsquo;t plumb forget dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his long-delayed
      fire. Flapjacks and bacon and warmed-over beans constituted his supper.
      Then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals, listening to the night
      noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon. After that he
      unrolled his bed, took off his heavy shoes, and pulled the blankets up to
      his chin. His face showed white in the moonlight, like the face of a
      corpse. But it was a corpse that knew its resurrection, for the man rose
      suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Pocket,&rdquo; he called sleepily. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the
      sun smote his closed eyelids, when he awoke with a start and looked about
      him until he had established the continuity of his existence and
      identified his present self with the days previously lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dress, he had merely to buckle on his shoes. He glanced at his
      fireplace and at his hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation and
      started the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep yer shirt on, Bill; keep yer shirt on,&rdquo; he admonished himself.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of rushin&rsquo;? No use in gettin&rsquo; all het up an&rsquo; sweaty. Mr.
      Pocket&rsquo;ll wait for you. He ain&rsquo;t a-runnin&rsquo; away before you can get yer
      breakfast. Now, what you want, Bill, is something fresh in yer bill o&rsquo; 
      fare. So it&rsquo;s up to you to go an&rsquo; get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cut a short pole at the water&rsquo;s edge and drew from one of his pockets a
      bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe they&rsquo;ll bite in the early morning,&rdquo; he muttered, as he made his
      first cast into the pool. And a moment later he was gleefully crying:
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I tell you, eh? What&rsquo;d I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no reel, nor any inclination to waste time, and by main strength,
      and swiftly, he drew out of the water a flashing ten-inch trout. Three
      more, caught in rapid succession, furnished his breakfast. When he came to
      the stepping-stones on his way to his hillside, he was struck by a sudden
      thought, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just better take a hike down-stream a ways,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
      tellin&rsquo; what cuss may be snoopin&rsquo; around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he crossed over on the stones, and with a &ldquo;I really oughter take that
      hike,&rdquo; the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he fell to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nightfall he straightened up. The small of his back was stiff from
      stooping toil, and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting
      muscles, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what d&rsquo;ye think of that, by damn? I clean forgot my dinner again! If
      I don&rsquo;t watch out, I&rsquo;ll sure be degeneratin&rsquo; into a two-meal-a-day crank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pockets is the damnedest things I ever see for makin&rsquo; a man
      absent-minded,&rdquo; he communed that night, as he crawled into his blankets.
      Nor did he forget to call up the hillside, &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Pocket! Good
      night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rising with the sun, and snatching a hasty breakfast, he was early at
      work. A fever seemed to be growing in him, nor did the increasing richness
      of the test-pans allay this fever. There was a flush in his cheek other
      than that made by the heat of the sun, and he was oblivious to fatigue and
      the passage of time. When he filled a pan with dirt, he ran down the hill
      to wash it; nor could he forbear running up the hill again, panting and
      stumbling profanely, to refill the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now a hundred yards from the water, and the inverted &ldquo;V&rdquo; was
      assuming definite proportions. The width of the pay-dirt steadily
      decreased, and the man extended in his mind&rsquo;s eye the sides of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; to
      their meeting-place far up the hill. This was his goal, the apex of the
      &ldquo;V,&rdquo; and he panned many times to locate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about two yards above that manzanita bush an&rsquo; a yard to the right,&rdquo;
       he finally concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the temptation seized him. &ldquo;As plain as the nose on your face,&rdquo; he
      said, as he abandoned his laborious cross-cutting and climbed to the
      indicated apex. He filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash. It
      contained no trace of gold. He dug deep, and he dug shallow, filling and
      washing a dozen pans, and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden speck.
      He was enraged at having yielded to the temptation, and cursed himself
      blasphemously and pridelessly. Then he went down the hill and took up the
      cross-cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slow an&rsquo; certain, Bill; slow an&rsquo; certain,&rdquo; he crooned. &ldquo;Short-cuts to
      fortune ain&rsquo;t in your line, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s about time you know it. Get wise,
      Bill; get wise. Slow an&rsquo; certain&rsquo;s the only hand you can play; so go to
      it, an&rsquo; keep to it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the cross-cuts decreased, showing that the sides of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; were
      converging, the depth of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; increased. The gold-trace was dipping
      into the hill. It was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he
      could get colors in his pan. The dirt he found at twenty-five inches from
      the surface, and at thirty-five inches, yielded barren pans. At the base
      of the &ldquo;V,&rdquo; by the water&rsquo;s edge, he had found the gold colors at the grass
      roots. The higher he went up the hill, the deeper the gold dipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      To dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one test-pan was a task of
      no mean magnitude; while between the man and the apex intervened an untold
      number of such holes to be. &ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; how much deeper it&rsquo;ll
      pitch,&rdquo; he sighed, in a moment&rsquo;s pause, while his fingers soothed his
      aching back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feverish with desire, with aching back and stiffening muscles, with pick
      and shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth, the man toiled up the
      hill. Before him was the smooth slope, spangled with flowers and made
      sweet with their breath. Behind him was devastation. It looked like some
      terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill. His slow
      progress was like that of a slug, befouling beauty with a monstrous trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the dipping gold-trace increased the man&rsquo;s work, he found
      consolation in the increasing richness of the pans. Twenty cents, thirty
      cents, fifty cents, sixty cents, were the values of the gold found in the
      pans, and at nightfall he washed his banner pan, which gave him a dollar&rsquo;s
      worth of gold-dust from a shovelful of dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just bet it&rsquo;s my luck to have some inquisitive cuss come buttin&rsquo; in
      here on my pasture,&rdquo; he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the
      blankets up to his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he sat upright. &ldquo;Bill!&rdquo; he called sharply. &ldquo;Now, listen to me,
      Bill; d&rsquo;ye hear! It&rsquo;s up to you, to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, to mosey round an&rsquo; see
      what you can see. Understand? Tomorrow morning, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yawned and glanced across at his side-hill. &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Pocket,&rdquo;
       he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning he stole a march on the sun, for he had finished breakfast
      when its first rays caught him, and he was climbing the wall of the canyon
      where it crumbled away and gave footing. From the outlook at the top he
      found himself in the midst of loneliness. As far as he could see, chain
      after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his vision. To the east
      his eyes, leaping the miles between range and range and between many
      ranges, brought up at last against the white-peaked Sierras&mdash;the main
      crest, where the backbone of the Western world reared itself against the
      sky. To the north and south he could see more distinctly the cross-systems
      that broke through the main trend of the sea of mountains. To the west the
      ranges fell away, one behind the other, diminishing and fading into the
      gentle foothills that, in turn, descended into the great valley which he
      could not see.

    <p>
      And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the
      handiwork of man&mdash;save only the torn bosom of the hillside at his
      feet. The man looked long and carefully. Once, far down his own canyon, he
      thought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke. He looked again and
      decided that it was the purple haze of the hills made dark by a
      convolution of the canyon wall at its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, you, Mr. Pocket!&rdquo; he called down into the canyon. &ldquo;Stand out from
      under! I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;, Mr. Pocket! I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy brogans on the man&rsquo;s feet made him appear clumsy-footed, but he
      swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain goat.
      A rock, turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice, did not
      disconcert him. He seemed to know the precise time required for the turn
      to culminate in disaster, and in the meantime he utilized the false
      footing itself for the momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on
      into safety. Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to
      stand for a second upright, the man did not hesitate. His foot pressed the
      impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the
      bound that carried him onward. Again, where even the fraction of a
      second&rsquo;s footing was out of the question, he would swing his body past by
      a moment&rsquo;s hand-grip on a jutting knob of rock, a crevice, or a
      precariously rooted shrub. At last, with a wild leap and yell, he
      exchanged the face of the wall for an earth-slide and finished the descent
      in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold.
      It was from the centre of the &ldquo;V.&rdquo; To either side the diminution in the
      values of the pans was swift. His lines of crosscutting holes were growing
      very short. The converging sides of the inverted &ldquo;V&rdquo; were only a few yards
      apart. Their meeting-point was only a few yards above him. But the
      pay-streak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth. By early
      afternoon he was sinking the test-holes five feet before the pans could
      show the gold-trace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that matter, the gold-trace had become something more than a trace; it
      was a placer mine in itself, and the man resolved to come back after he
      had found the pocket and work over the ground. But the increasing richness
      of the pans began to worry him. By late afternoon the worth of the pans
      had grown to three and four dollars. The man scratched his head
      perplexedly and looked a few feet up the hill at the manzanita bush that
      marked approximately the apex of the &ldquo;V.&rdquo; He nodded his head and said
      oracularly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; two things, Bill; one o&rsquo; two things. Either Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s
      spilled himself all out an&rsquo; down the hill, or else Mr. Pocket&rsquo;s that
      damned rich you maybe won&rsquo;t be able to carry him all away with you. And
      that&rsquo;d be hell, wouldn&rsquo;t it, now?&rdquo; He chuckled at contemplation of so
      pleasant a dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightfall found him by the edge of the stream his eyes wrestling with the
      gathering darkness over the washing of a five-dollar pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisht I had an electric light to go on working.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found sleep difficult that night. Many times he composed himself and
      closed his eyes for slumber to overtake him; but his blood pounded with
      too strong desire, and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured
      wearily, &ldquo;Wisht it was sun-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sleep came to him in the end, but his eyes were open with the first paling
      of the stars, and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast finished and
      climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret abiding-place of Mr.
      Pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first cross-cut the man made, there was space for only three holes, so
      narrow had become the pay-streak and so close was he to the fountainhead
      of the golden stream he had been following for four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ca&rsquo;m, Bill; be ca&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he admonished himself, as he broke ground for
      the final hole where the sides of the &ldquo;V&rdquo; had at last come together in a
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the almighty cinch on you, Mr. Pocket, an&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t lose me,&rdquo;
       he said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four feet, five feet, six feet, he dug his way down into the earth. The
      digging grew harder. His pick grated on broken rock. He examined the rock.
      &ldquo;Rotten quartz,&rdquo; was his conclusion as, with the shovel, he cleared the
      bottom of the hole of loose dirt. He attacked the crumbling quartz with
      the pick, bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with every stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his shovel into the loose mass. His eye caught a gleam of
      yellow. He dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels. As a
      farmer rubs the clinging earth from fresh-dug potatoes, so the man, a
      piece of rotten quartz held in both hands, rubbed the dirt away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; Sardanopolis!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Lumps an&rsquo; chunks of it! Lumps an&rsquo; 
      chunks of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only half rock he held in his hand. The other half was virgin gold.
      He dropped it into his pan and examined another piece. Little yellow was
      to be seen, but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away
      till both hands were filled with glowing yellow. He rubbed the dirt away
      from fragment after fragment, tossing them into the gold-pan. It was a
      treasure-hole. So much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of
      it than there was of gold. Now and again he found a piece to which no rock
      clung&mdash;a piece that was all gold. A chunk, where the pick had laid
      open the heart of the gold, glittered like a handful of yellow jewels, and
      he cocked his head at it and slowly turned it around and over to observe
      the rich play of the light upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk about yer Too Much Gold diggin&rsquo;s!&rdquo; the man snorted contemptuously.
      &ldquo;Why, this diggin&rsquo; &lsquo;d make it look like thirty cents. This diggin&rsquo; is All
      Gold. An&rsquo; right here an&rsquo; now I name this yere canyon &lsquo;All Gold Canyon,&rsquo; b&rsquo; 
      gosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still squatting on his heels, he continued examining the fragments and
      tossing them into the pan. Suddenly there came to him a premonition of
      danger. It seemed a shadow had fallen upon him. But there was no shadow.
      His heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him.
      Then his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold
      against his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not spring up nor look around. He did not move. He was considering
      the nature of the premonition he had received, trying to locate the source
      of the mysterious force that had warned him, striving to sense the
      imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened him. There is an
      aura of things hostile, made manifest by messengers refined for the senses
      to know; and this aura he felt, but knew not how he felt it. His was the
      feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun. It seemed that between him
      and life had passed something dark and smothering and menacing; a gloom,
      as it were, that swallowed up life and made for death&mdash;his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the unseen
      danger, but his soul dominated the panic, and he remained squatting on his
      heels, in his hands a chunk of gold. He did not dare to look around, but
      he knew by now that there was something behind him and above him. He made
      believe to be interested in the gold in his hand. He examined it
      critically, turned it over and over, and rubbed the dirt from it. And all
      the time he knew that something behind him was looking at the gold over
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand, he listened
      intently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him. His eyes
      searched the ground in front of him for a weapon, but they saw only the
      uprooted gold, worthless to him now in his extremity. There was his pick,
      a handy weapon on occasion; but this was not such an occasion. The man
      realized his predicament. He was in a narrow hole that was seven feet
      deep. His head did not come to the surface of the ground. He was in a
      trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained squatting on his heels. He was quite cool and collected; but
      his mind, considering every factor, showed him only his helplessness. He
      continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the gold
      into the pan. There was nothing else for him to do. Yet he knew that he
      would have to rise up, sooner or later, and face the danger that breathed
      at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed, and with the passage of each minute he knew that by so
      much he was nearer the time when he must stand up, or else&mdash;and his
      wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the thought&mdash;or else
      he might receive death as he stooped there over his treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing dirt from gold and debating in
      just what manner he should rise up. He might rise up with a rush and claw
      his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing
      above ground. Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and feign
      casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back. His instinct and
      every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad, clawing rush to the
      surface. His intellect, and the craft thereof, favored the slow and
      cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see.
      And while he debated, a loud, crashing noise burst on his ear. At the same
      instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back, and from
      the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his flesh. He sprang up
      in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed. His body crumpled in like a
      leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down, his chest across his pan
      of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his legs tangled and twisted
      because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole. His legs
      twitched convulsively several times. His body was shaken as with a mighty
      ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs, accompanied by a deep sigh.
      Then the air was slowly, very slowly, exhaled, and his body as slowly
      flattened itself down into inertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above, revolver in hand, a man was peering down over the edge of the hole.
      He peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath him.
      After a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that he
      could see into it, and rested the revolver on his knee. Reaching his hand
      into a pocket, he drew out a wisp of brown paper. Into this he dropped a
      few crumbs of tobacco. The combination became a cigarette, brown and
      squat, with the ends turned in. Not once did he take his eyes from the
      body at the bottom of the hole. He lighted the cigarette and drew its
      smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath. He smoked
      slowly. Once the cigarette went out and he relighted it. And all the while
      he studied the body beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet. He
      moved to the edge of the hole. Spanning it, a hand resting on each edge,
      and with the revolver still in the right hand, he muscled his body down
      into the hole. While his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he released
      his hands and dropped down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocket-miner&rsquo;s arm leap
      out, and his own legs knew a swift, jerking grip that overthrew him. In
      the nature of the jump his revolver-hand was above his head. Swiftly as
      the grip had flashed about his legs, just as swiftly he brought the
      revolver down. He was still in the air, his fall in process of completion,
      when he pulled the trigger. The explosion was deafening in the confined
      space. The smoke filled the hole so that he could see nothing. He struck
      the bottom on his back, and like a cat&rsquo;s the pocket-miner&rsquo;s body was on
      top of him. Even as the miner&rsquo;s body passed on top, the stranger crooked
      in his right arm to fire; and even in that instant the miner, with a quick
      thrust of elbow, struck his wrist. The muzzle was thrown up and the bullet
      thudded into the dirt of the side of the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant the stranger felt the miner&rsquo;s hand grip his wrist. The
      struggle was now for the revolver. Each man strove to turn it against the
      other&rsquo;s body. The smoke in the hole was clearing. The stranger, lying on
      his back, was beginning to see dimly. But suddenly he was blinded by a
      handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist. In
      that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken. In the next
      moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain, and in the
      midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the pocket-miner fired again and again, until the revolver was empty.
      Then he tossed it from him and, breathing heavily, sat down on the dead
      man&rsquo;s legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miner was sobbing and struggling for breath. &ldquo;Measly skunk!&rdquo; he
      panted; &ldquo;a-campin&rsquo; on my trail an&rsquo; lettin&rsquo; me do the work, an&rsquo; then
      shootin&rsquo; me in the back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was half crying from anger and exhaustion. He peered at the face of the
      dead man. It was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel, and it was
      difficult to distinguish the features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never laid eyes on him before,&rdquo; the miner concluded his scrutiny. &ldquo;Just a
      common an&rsquo; ordinary thief, damn him! An&rsquo; he shot me in the back! He shot
      me in the back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his shirt and felt himself, front and back, on his left side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went clean through, and no harm done!&rdquo; he cried jubilantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he
      aimed right all right, but he drew the gun over when he pulled the trigger&mdash;the
      cuss! But I fixed &lsquo;m! Oh, I fixed &lsquo;m!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fingers were investigating the bullet-hole in his side, and a shade of
      regret passed over his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be stiffer&rsquo;n hell,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s up to me to get mended an&rsquo; get out o&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp. Half an
      hour later he returned, leading his pack-horse. His open shirt disclosed
      the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound. He was slow and
      awkward with his left-hand movements, but that did not prevent his using
      the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bight of the pack-rope under the dead man&rsquo;s shoulders enabled him to
      heave the body out of the hole. Then he set to work gathering up his gold.
      He worked steadily for several hours, pausing often to rest his stiffening
      shoulder and to exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shot me in the back, the measly skunk! He shot me in the back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a number
      of blanket-covered parcels, he made an estimate of its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred pounds, or I&rsquo;m a Hottentot,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Say two hundred
      in quartz an&rsquo; dirt&mdash;that leaves two hundred pounds of gold. Bill!
      Wake up! Two hundred pounds of gold! Forty thousand dollars! An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
      yourn&mdash;all yourn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an
      unfamiliar groove. They quested along it for several inches. It was a
      crease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked angrily over to the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, would you?&rdquo; he bullied. &ldquo;You would, eh? Well, I fixed you good
      an&rsquo; plenty, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give you decent burial, too. That&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n you&rsquo;d have
      done for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in. It struck
      the bottom with a dull crash, on its side, the face twisted up to the
      light. The miner peered down at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; you shot me in the back!&rdquo; he said accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With pick and shovel he filled the hole. Then he loaded the gold on his
      horse. It was too great a load for the animal, and when he had gained his
      camp he transferred part of it to his saddle-horse. Even so, he was
      compelled to abandon a portion of his outfit&mdash;pick and shovel and
      gold-pan, extra food and cooking utensils, and divers odds and ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen of
      vines and creepers. To climb the huge boulders the animals were compelled
      to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of vegetation.
      Once the saddle-horse fell heavily and the man removed the pack to get the
      animal on its feet. After it started on its way again the man thrust his
      head out from among the leaves and peered up at the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The measly skunk!&rdquo; he said, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs. The trees surged back
      and forth, marking the passage of the animals through the midst of them.
      There was a clashing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and now and again an
      oath or a sharp cry of command. Then the voice of the man was raised in
      song:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Tu&rsquo;n around an&rsquo; tu&rsquo;n yo&rsquo; face
    Untoe them sweet hills of grace
      (D&rsquo; pow&rsquo;rs of sin yo&rsquo; am scornin&rsquo;!).
    Look about an, look aroun&rsquo;,
    Fling yo&rsquo; sin-pack on d&rsquo; groun&rsquo; 
      (Yo&rsquo; will meet wid d&rsquo; Lord in d&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;!).&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The song grew faint and fainter, and through the silence crept back the
      spirit of the place. The stream once more drowsed and whispered; the hum
      of the mountain bees rose sleepily. Down through the perfume-weighted air
      fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. The butterflies drifted in
      and out among the trees, and over all blazed the quiet sunshine. Only
      remained the hoof-marks in the meadow and the torn hillside to mark the
      boisterous trail of the life that had broken the peace of the place and
      passed on.

      PLANCHETTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my right to know,&rdquo; the girl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was firm-fibred with determination. There was no hint of
      pleading in it, yet it was the determination that is reached through a
      long period of pleading. But in her case it had been pleading, not of
      speech, but of personality. Her lips had been ever mute, but her face and
      eyes, and the very attitude of her soul, had been for a long time eloquent
      with questioning. This the man had known, but he had never answered; and
      now she was demanding by the spoken word that he answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my right,&rdquo; the girl repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he answered, desperately and helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, in the silence which followed, her eyes fixed upon the light
      that filtered down through the lofty boughs and bathed the great redwood
      trunks in mellow warmth. This light, subdued and colored, seemed almost a
      radiation from the trunks themselves, so strongly did they saturate it
      with their hue. The girl saw without seeing, as she heard, without
      hearing, the deep gurgling of the stream far below on the canyon bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at the man. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, with the firmness which
      feigns belief that obedience will be forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting upright, her back against a fallen tree-trunk, while he
      lay near to her, on his side, an elbow on the ground and the hand
      supporting his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear Lute,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered at the sound of his voice&mdash;not from repulsion, but from
      struggle against the fascination of its caressing gentleness. She had come
      to know well the lure of the man&mdash;the wealth of easement and rest
      that was promised by every caressing intonation of his voice, by the mere
      touch of hand on hand or the faint impact of his breath on neck or cheek.
      The man could not express himself by word nor look nor touch without
      weaving into the expression, subtly and occultly, the feeling as of a hand
      that passed and that in passing stroked softly and soothingly. Nor was
      this all-pervading caress a something that cloyed with too great
      sweetness; nor was it sickly sentimental; nor was it maudlin with love&rsquo;s
      madness. It was vigorous, compelling, masculine. For that matter, it was
      largely unconscious on the man&rsquo;s part. He was only dimly aware of it. It
      was a part of him, the breath of his soul as it were, involuntary and
      unpremeditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, resolved and desperate, she steeled herself against him. He tried
      to face her, but her gray eyes looked out to him, steadily, from under
      cool, level brows, and he dropped his head upon her knee. Her hand strayed
      into his hair softly, and her face melted into solicitude and tenderness.
      But when he looked up again, her gray eyes were steady, her brows cool and
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more can I tell you?&rdquo; the man said. He raised his head and met her
      gaze. &ldquo;I cannot marry you. I cannot marry any woman. I love you&mdash;you
      know that&mdash;better than my own life. I weigh you in the scales against
      all the dear things of living, and you outweigh everything. I would give
      everything to possess you, yet I may not. I cannot marry you. I can never
      marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips were compressed with the effort of control. His head was sinking
      back to her knee, when she checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are already married, Chris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he cried vehemently. &ldquo;I have never been married. I want to marry
      only you, and I cannot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my right to know,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he again interrupted. &ldquo;But I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not considered me, Chris,&rdquo; she went on gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot have considered me. You do not know what I have to bear from
      my people because of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think they felt so very unkindly toward me,&rdquo; he said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. They can scarcely tolerate you. They do not show it to you,
      but they almost hate you. It is I who have had to bear all this. It was
      not always so, though. They liked you at first as... as I liked you. But
      that was four years ago. The time passed by&mdash;a year, two years; and
      then they began to turn against you. They are not to be blamed. You spoke
      no word. They felt that you were destroying my life. It is four years,
      now, and you have never once mentioned marriage to them. What were they to
      think? What they have thought, that you were destroying my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she talked, she continued to pass her fingers caressingly through his
      hair, sorrowful for the pain that she was inflicting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did like you at first. Who can help liking you? You seem to draw
      affection from all living things, as the trees draw the moisture from the
      ground. It comes to you as it were your birthright. Aunt Mildred and Uncle
      Robert thought there was nobody like you. The sun rose and set in you.
      They thought I was the luckiest girl alive to win the love of a man like
      you. &lsquo;For it looks very much like it,&rsquo; Uncle Robert used to say, wagging
      his head wickedly at me. Of course they liked you. Aunt Mildred used to
      sigh, and look across teasingly at Uncle, and say, &lsquo;When I think of Chris,
      it almost makes me wish I were younger myself.&rsquo; And Uncle would answer, &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t blame you, my dear, not in the least.&rsquo; And then the pair of them
      would beam upon me their congratulations that I had won the love of a man
      like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they knew I loved you as well. How could I hide it?&mdash;this great,
      wonderful thing that had entered into my life and swallowed up all my
      days! For four years, Chris, I have lived only for you. Every moment was
      yours. Waking, I loved you. Sleeping, I dreamed of you. Every act I have
      performed was shaped by you, by the thought of you. Even my thoughts were
      moulded by you, by the invisible presence of you. I had no end, petty or
      great, that you were not there for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea of imposing such slavery,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You imposed nothing. You always let me have my own way. It was you who
      were the obedient slave. You did for me without offending me. You
      forestalled my wishes without the semblance of forestalling them, so
      natural and inevitable was everything you did for me. I said, without
      offending me. You were no dancing puppet. You made no fuss. Don&rsquo;t you see?
      You did not seem to do things at all. Somehow they were always there, just
      done, as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slavery was love&rsquo;s slavery. It was just my love for you that made you
      swallow up all my days. You did not force yourself into my thoughts. You
      crept in, always, and you were there always&mdash;how much, you will never
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as time went by, Aunt Mildred and Uncle grew to dislike you. They
      grew afraid. What was to become of me? You were destroying my life. My
      music? You know how my dream of it has dimmed away. That spring, when I
      first met you&mdash;I was twenty, and I was about to start for Germany. I
      was going to study hard. That was four years ago, and I am still here in
      California.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had other lovers. You drove them away&mdash;No! no! I don&rsquo;t mean that.
      It was I that drove them away. What did I care for lovers, for anything,
      when you were near? But as I said, Aunt Mildred and Uncle grew afraid.
      There has been talk&mdash;friends, busybodies, and all the rest. The time
      went by. You did not speak. I could only wonder, wonder. I knew you loved
      me. Much was said against you by Uncle at first, and then by Aunt Mildred.
      They were father and mother to me, you know. I could not defend you. Yet I
      was loyal to you. I refused to discuss you. I closed up. There was
      half-estrangement in my home&mdash;Uncle Robert with a face like an
      undertaker, and Aunt Mildred&rsquo;s heart breaking. But what could I do, Chris?
      What could I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, his head resting on her knee again, groaned, but made no other
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Mildred was mother to me, yet I went to her no more with my
      confidences. My childhood&rsquo;s book was closed. It was a sweet book, Chris.
      The tears come into my eyes sometimes when I think of it. But never mind
      that. Great happiness has been mine as well. I am glad I can talk frankly
      of my love for you. And the attaining of such frankness has been very
      sweet. I do love you, Chris. I love you... I cannot tell you how. You are
      everything to me, and more besides. You remember that Christmas tree of
      the children?&mdash;when we played blindman&rsquo;s buff? and you caught me by
      the arm so, with such a clutching of fingers that I cried out with the
      hurt? I never told you, but the arm was badly bruised. And such sweet I
      got of it you could never guess. There, black and blue, was the imprint of
      your fingers&mdash;your fingers, Chris, your fingers. It was the touch of
      you made visible. It was there a week, and I kissed the marks&mdash;oh, so
      often! I hated to see them go; I wanted to rebruise the arm and make them
      linger. I was jealous of the returning white that drove the bruise away.
      Somehow,&mdash;oh! I cannot explain, but I loved you so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that fell, she continued her caressing of his hair, while
      she idly watched a great gray squirrel, boisterous and hilarious, as it
      scampered back and forth in a distant vista of the redwoods. A
      crimson-crested woodpecker, energetically drilling a fallen trunk, caught
      and transferred her gaze. The man did not lift his head. Rather, he
      crushed his face closer against her knee, while his heaving shoulders
      marked the hardness with which he breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me, Chris,&rdquo; the girl said gently. &ldquo;This mystery&mdash;it is
      killing me. I must know why we cannot be married. Are we always to be this
      way?&mdash;merely lovers, meeting often, it is true, and yet with the long
      absences between the meetings? Is it all the world holds for you and me,
      Chris? Are we never to be more to each other? Oh, it is good just to love,
      I know&mdash;you have made me madly happy; but one does get so hungry at
      times for something more! I want more and more of you, Chris. I want all
      of you. I want all our days to be together. I want all the companionship,
      the comradeship, which cannot be ours now, and which will be ours when we
      are married&mdash;&rdquo; She caught her breath quickly. &ldquo;But we are never to be
      married. I forgot. And you must tell me why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man raised his head and looked her in the eyes. It was a way he had
      with whomever he talked, of looking them in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have considered you, Lute,&rdquo; he began doggedly. &ldquo;I did consider you at
      the very first. I should never have gone on with it. I should have gone
      away. I knew it. And I considered you in the light of that knowledge, and
      yet... I did not go away. My God! what was I to do? I loved you. I could
      not go away. I could not help it. I stayed. I resolved, but I broke my
      resolves. I was like a drunkard. I was drunk of you. I was weak, I know. I
      failed. I could not go away. I tried. I went away&mdash;you will remember,
      though you did not know why. You know now. I went away, but I could not
      remain away. Knowing that we could never marry, I came back to you. I am
      here, now, with you. Send me away, Lute. I have not the strength to go
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you go away?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Besides, I must know why, before
      I can send you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, her voice tenderly imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Lute; don&rsquo;t force me,&rdquo; the man pleaded, and there was appeal in
      his eyes and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must tell me,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;It is justice you owe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man wavered. &ldquo;If I do...&rdquo; he began. Then he ended with determination,
      &ldquo;I should never be able to forgive myself. No, I cannot tell you. Don&rsquo;t
      try to compel me, Lute. You would be as sorry as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is anything... if there are obstacles... if this mystery does
      really prevent...&rdquo; She was speaking slowly, with long pauses, seeking the
      more delicate ways of speech for the framing of her thought. &ldquo;Chris, I do
      love you. I love you as deeply as it is possible for any woman to love, I
      am sure. If you were to say to me now &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; I would go with you. I would
      follow wherever you led. I would be your page, as in the days of old when
      ladies went with their knights to far lands. You are my knight, Chris, and
      you can do no wrong. Your will is my wish. I was once afraid of the
      censure of the world. Now that you have come into my life I am no longer
      afraid. I would laugh at the world and its censure for your sake&mdash;for
      my sake too. I would laugh, for I should have you, and you are more to me
      than the good will and approval of the world. If you say &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; I will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is impossible! Marriage or not, I cannot
      even say &lsquo;Come.&rsquo; I dare not. I&rsquo;ll show you. I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat up beside her, the action stamped with resolve. He took her hand in
      his and held it closely. His lips moved to the verge of speech. The
      mystery trembled for utterance. The air was palpitant with its presence.
      As if it were an irrevocable decree, the girl steeled herself to hear. But
      the man paused, gazing straight out before him. She felt his hand relax in
      hers, and she pressed it sympathetically, encouragingly. But she felt the
      rigidity going out of his tensed body, and she knew that spirit and flesh
      were relaxing together. His resolution was ebbing. He would not speak&mdash;she
      knew it; and she knew, likewise, with the sureness of faith, that it was
      because he could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed despairingly before her, a numb feeling at her heart, as though
      hope and happiness had died. She watched the sun flickering down through
      the warm-trunked redwoods. But she watched in a mechanical, absent way.
      She looked at the scene as from a long way off, without interest, herself
      an alien, no longer an intimate part of the earth and trees and flowers
      she loved so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far removed did she seem, that she was aware of a curiosity, strangely
      impersonal, in what lay around her. Through a near vista she looked at a
      buckeye tree in full blossom as though her eyes encountered it for the
      first time. Her eyes paused and dwelt upon a yellow cluster of Diogenes&rsquo; 
      lanterns that grew on the edge of an open space. It was the way of flowers
      always to give her quick pleasure-thrills, but no thrill was hers now. She
      pondered the flower slowly and thoughtfully, as a hasheesh-eater, heavy
      with the drug, might ponder some whim-flower that obtruded on his vision.
      In her ears was the voice of the stream&mdash;a hoarse-throated, sleepy
      old giant, muttering and mumbling his somnolent fancies. But her fancy was
      not in turn aroused, as was its wont; she knew the sound merely for water
      rushing over the rocks of the deep canyon-bottom, that and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze wandered on beyond the Diogenes&rsquo; lanterns into the open space.
      Knee-deep in the wild oats of the hillside grazed two horses,
      chestnut-sorrels the pair of them, perfectly matched, warm and golden in
      the sunshine, their spring-coats a sheen of high-lights shot through with
      color-flashes that glowed like fiery jewels. She recognized, almost with a
      shock, that one of them was hers, Dolly, the companion of her girlhood and
      womanhood, on whose neck she had sobbed her sorrows and sung her joys. A
      moistness welled into her eyes at the sight, and she came back from the
      remoteness of her mood, quick with passion and sorrow, to be part of the
      world again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man sank forward from the hips, relaxing entirely, and with a groan
      dropped his head on her knee. She leaned over him and pressed her lips
      softly and lingeringly to his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us go,&rdquo; she said, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath in a half-sob, then tightened her lips as she rose.
      His face was white to ghastliness, so shaken was he by the struggle
      through which he had passed. They did not look at each other, but walked
      directly to the horses. She leaned against Dolly&rsquo;s neck while he tightened
      the girths. Then she gathered the reins in her hand and waited. He looked
      at her as he bent down, an appeal for forgiveness in his eyes; and in that
      moment her own eyes answered. Her foot rested in his hands, and from there
      she vaulted into the saddle. Without speaking, without further looking at
      each other, they turned the horses&rsquo; heads and took the narrow trail that
      wound down through the sombre redwood aisles and across the open glades to
      the pasture-lands below. The trail became a cow-path, the cow-path became
      a wood-road, which later joined with a hay-road; and they rode down
      through the low-rolling, tawny California hills to where a set of bars let
      out on the county road which ran along the bottom of the valley. The girl
      sat her horse while the man dismounted and began taking down the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;wait!&rdquo; she cried, before he had touched the two lower bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      She urged the mare forward a couple of strides, and then the animal lifted
      over the bars in a clean little jump. The man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and he
      clapped his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You beauty! you beauty!&rdquo; the girl cried, leaning forward impulsively in
      the saddle and pressing her cheek to the mare&rsquo;s neck where it burned
      flame-color in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s trade horses for the ride in,&rdquo; she suggested, when he had led his
      horse through and finished putting up the bars. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never sufficiently
      appreciated Dolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think she is too old, too sedate,&rdquo; Lute insisted. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only
      sixteen, and she can outrun nine colts out of ten. Only she never cuts up.
      She&rsquo;s too steady, and you don&rsquo;t approve of her&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t deny it,
      sir. I know. And I know also that she can outrun your vaunted Washoe Ban.
      There! I challenge you! And furthermore, you may ride her yourself. You
      know what Ban can do; so you must ride Dolly and see for yourself what she
      can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded to exchange the saddles on the horses, glad of the
      diversion and making the most of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I was born in California,&rdquo; Lute remarked, as she swung astride
      of Ban. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage both to horse and woman to ride in a sidesaddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like a young Amazon,&rdquo; the man said approvingly, his eyes passing
      tenderly over the girl as she swung the horse around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the old mill,&rdquo; she called, as the horses sprang forward. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s less
      than a mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a finish?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and the horses, feeling the urge of the reins, caught the
      spirit of the race. The dust rose in clouds behind as they tore along the
      level road. They swung around the bend, horses and riders tilted at sharp
      angles to the ground, and more than once the riders ducked low to escape
      the branches of outreaching and overhanging trees. They clattered over the
      small plank bridges, and thundered over the larger iron ones to an ominous
      clanking of loose rods.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode side by side, saving the animals for the rush at the finish, yet
      putting them at a pace that drew upon vitality and staying power. Curving
      around a clump of white oaks, the road straightened out before them for
      several hundred yards, at the end of which they could see the ruined mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; the girl cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She urged the horse by suddenly leaning forward with her body, at the same
      time, for an instant, letting the rein slack and touching the neck with
      her bridle hand. She began to draw away from the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch her on the neck!&rdquo; she cried to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, the mare pulled alongside and began gradually to pass the girl.
      Chris and Lute looked at each other for a moment, the mare still drawing
      ahead, so that Chris was compelled slowly to turn his head. The mill was a
      hundred yards away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I give him the spurs?&rdquo; Lute shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded, and the girl drove the spurs in sharply and quickly,
      calling upon the horse for its utmost, but watched her own horse forge
      slowly ahead of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beaten by three lengths!&rdquo; Lute beamed triumphantly, as they pulled into a
      walk. &ldquo;Confess, sir, confess! You didn&rsquo;t think the old mare had it in
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute leaned to the side and rested her hand for a moment on Dolly&rsquo;s wet
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ban&rsquo;s a sluggard alongside of her,&rdquo; Chris affirmed. &ldquo;Dolly&rsquo;s all right,
      if she is in her Indian Summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute nodded approval. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sweet way of putting it&mdash;Indian
      Summer. It just describes her. But she&rsquo;s not lazy. She has all the fire
      and none of the folly. She is very wise, what of her years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That accounts for it,&rdquo; Chris demurred. &ldquo;Her folly passed with her youth.
      Many&rsquo;s the lively time she&rsquo;s given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lute answered. &ldquo;I never knew her really to cut up. I think the only
      trouble she ever gave me was when I was training her to open gates. She
      was afraid when they swung back upon her&mdash;the animal&rsquo;s fear of the
      trap, perhaps. But she bravely got over it. And she never was vicious. She
      never bolted, nor bucked, nor cut up in all her life&mdash;never, not
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horses went on at a walk, still breathing heavily from their run. The
      road wound along the bottom of the valley, now and again crossing the
      stream. From either side rose the drowsy purr of mowing-machines,
      punctuated by occasional sharp cries of the men who were gathering the
      hay-crop. On the western side of the valley the hills rose green and dark,
      but the eastern side was already burned brown and tan by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is summer, here is spring,&rdquo; Lute said. &ldquo;Oh, beautiful Sonoma
      Valley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were glistening and her face was radiant with love of the land.
      Her gaze wandered on across orchard patches and sweeping vineyard
      stretches, seeking out the purple which seemed to hang like a dim smoke in
      the wrinkles of the hills and in the more distant canyon gorges. Far up,
      among the more rugged crests, where the steep slopes were covered with
      manzanita, she caught a glimpse of a clear space where the wild grass had
      not yet lost its green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard of the secret pasture?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes still
      fixed on the remote green.
    </p>
    <p>
      A snort of fear brought her eyes back to the man beside her. Dolly,
      upreared, with distended nostrils and wild eyes, was pawing the air madly
      with her fore legs. Chris threw himself forward against her neck to keep
      her from falling backward, and at the same time touched her with the spurs
      to compel her to drop her fore feet to the ground in order to obey the
      go-ahead impulse of the spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dolly, this is most remarkable,&rdquo; Lute began reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to her surprise, the mare threw her head down, arched her back as she
      went up in the air, and, returning, struck the ground stiff-legged and
      bunched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A genuine buck!&rdquo; Chris called out, and the next moment the mare was
      rising under him in a second buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute looked on, astounded at the unprecedented conduct of her mare, and
      admiring her lover&rsquo;s horsemanship. He was quite cool, and was himself
      evidently enjoying the performance. Again and again, half a dozen times,
      Dolly arched herself into the air and struck, stiffly bunched. Then she
      threw her head straight up and rose on her hind legs, pivoting about and
      striking with her fore feet. Lute whirled into safety the horse she was
      riding, and as she did so caught a glimpse of Dolly&rsquo;s eyes, with the look
      in them of blind brute madness, bulging until it seemed they must burst
      from her head. The faint pink in the white of the eyes was gone, replaced
      by a white that was like dull marble and that yet flashed as from some
      inner fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint cry of fear, suppressed in the instant of utterance, slipped past
      Lute&rsquo;s lips. One hind leg of the mare seemed to collapse, and for a moment
      the whole quivering body, upreared and perpendicular, swayed back and
      forth, and there was uncertainty as to whether it would fall forward or
      backward. The man, half-slipping sidewise from the saddle, so as to fall
      clear if the mare toppled backward, threw his weight to the front and
      alongside her neck. This overcame the dangerous teetering balance, and the
      mare struck the ground on her feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no let-up. Dolly straightened out so that the line of the
      face was almost a continuation of the line of the stretched neck; this
      position enabled her to master the bit, which she did by bolting straight
      ahead down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Lute became really frightened. She spurred Washoe Ban
      in pursuit, but he could not hold his own with the mad mare, and dropped
      gradually behind. Lute saw Dolly check and rear in the air again, and
      caught up just as the mare made a second bolt. As Dolly dashed around a
      bend, she stopped suddenly, stiff-legged. Lute saw her lover torn out of
      the saddle, his thigh-grip broken by the sudden jerk. Though he had lost
      his seat, he had not been thrown, and as the mare dashed on Lute saw him
      clinging to the side of the horse, a hand in the mane and a leg across the
      saddle. With a quick cavort he regained his seat and proceeded to fight
      with the mare for control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dolly swerved from the road and dashed down a grassy slope yellowed
      with innumerable mariposa lilies. An ancient fence at the bottom was no
      obstacle. She burst through as though it were filmy spider-web and
      disappeared in the underbrush. Lute followed unhesitatingly, putting Ban
      through the gap in the fence and plunging on into the thicket. She lay
      along his neck, closely, to escape the ripping and tearing of the trees
      and vines. She felt the horse drop down through leafy branches and into
      the cool gravel of a stream&rsquo;s bottom. From ahead came a splashing of
      water, and she caught a glimpse of Dolly, dashing up the small bank and
      into a clump of scrub-oaks, against the trunks of which she was trying to
      scrape off her rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute almost caught up amongst the trees, but was hopelessly outdistanced
      on the fallow field adjoining, across which the mare tore with a fine
      disregard for heavy ground and gopher-holes. When she turned at a sharp
      angle into the thicket-land beyond, Lute took the long diagonal, skirted
      the ticket, and reined in Ban at the other side. She had arrived first.
      From within the thicket she could hear a tremendous crashing of brush and
      branches. Then the mare burst through and into the open, falling to her
      knees, exhausted, on the soft earth. She arose and staggered forward, then
      came limply to a halt. She was in lather-sweat of fear, and stood
      trembling pitiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris was still on her back. His shirt was in ribbons. The backs of his
      hands were bruised and lacerated, while his face was streaming blood from
      a gash near the temple. Lute had controlled herself well, but now she was
      aware of a quick nausea and a trembling of weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chris!&rdquo; she said, so softly that it was almost a whisper. Then she
      sighed, &ldquo;Thank God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he cried to her, putting into his voice all the
      heartiness he could command, which was not much, for he had himself been
      under no mean nervous strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed the reaction he was undergoing, when he swung down out of the
      saddle. He began with a brave muscular display as he lifted his leg over,
      but ended, on his feet, leaning against the limp Dolly for support. Lute
      flashed out of her saddle, and her arms were about him in an embrace of
      thankfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where there is a spring,&rdquo; she said, a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the horses standing untethered, and she led her lover into the
      cool recesses of the thicket to where crystal water bubbled from out the
      base of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that you said about Dolly&rsquo;s never cutting up?&rdquo; he asked, when
      the blood had been stanched and his nerves and pulse-beats were normal
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am stunned,&rdquo; Lute answered. &ldquo;I cannot understand it. She never did
      anything like it in all her life. And all animals like you so&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      not because of that. Why, she is a child&rsquo;s horse. I was only a little girl
      when I first rode her, and to this day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this day she was everything but a child&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; Chris broke in.
      &ldquo;She was a devil. She tried to scrape me off against the trees, and to
      batter my brains out against the limbs. She tried all the lowest and
      narrowest places she could find. You should have seen her squeeze through.
      And did you see those bucks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular bucking-bronco proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what should she know about bucking?&rdquo; Lute demanded. &ldquo;She was never
      known to buck&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Some forgotten instinct, perhaps, long-lapsed
      and come to life again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl rose to her feet determinedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back to the horses, where they subjected Dolly to a rigid
      examination that disclosed nothing. Hoofs, legs, bit, mouth, body&mdash;everything
      was as it should be. The saddle and saddle-cloth were innocent of bur or
      sticker; the back was smooth and unbroken. They searched for sign of
      snake-bite and sting of fly or insect, but found nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever it was, it was subjective, that much is certain,&rdquo; Chris said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obsession,&rdquo; Lute suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed together at the idea, for both were twentieth-century
      products, healthy-minded and normal, with souls that delighted in the
      butterfly-chase of ideals but that halted before the brink where
      superstition begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An evil spirit,&rdquo; Chris laughed; &ldquo;but what evil have I done that I should
      be so punished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think too much of yourself, sir,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;It is more likely
      some evil, I don&rsquo;t know what, that Dolly has done. You were a mere
      accident. I might have been on her back at the time, or Aunt Mildred, or
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she talked, she took hold of the stirrup-strap and started to shorten
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Chris demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ride Dolly in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;It would be bad discipline. After what
      has happened I am simply compelled to ride her in myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was a very weak and very sick mare he rode, stumbling and halting,
      afflicted with nervous jerks and recurring muscular spasms&mdash;the
      aftermath of the tremendous orgasm through which she had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like a book of verse and a hammock, after all that has happened,&rdquo;
       Lute said, as they rode into camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a summer camp of city-tired people, pitched in a grove of towering
      redwoods through whose lofty boughs the sunshine trickled down, broken and
      subdued to soft light and cool shadow. Apart from the main camp were the
      kitchen and the servants&rsquo; tents; and midway between was the great dining
      hall, walled by the living redwood columns, where fresh whispers of air
      were always to be found, and where no canopy was needed to keep the sun
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Dolly, she is really sick,&rdquo; Lute said that evening, when they had
      returned from a last look at the mare. &ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t hurt, Chris, and
      that&rsquo;s enough for one small woman to be thankful for. I thought I knew,
      but I really did not know till to-day, how much you meant to me. I could
      hear only the plunging and struggle in the thicket. I could not see you,
      nor know how it went with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My thoughts were of you,&rdquo; Chris answered, and felt the responsive
      pressure of the hand that rested on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face up to his and met his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lute, dear Lute,&rdquo; he caressed her with his voice as she moved away
      among the shadows.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    *       *       *
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going for the mail?&rdquo; called a woman&rsquo;s voice through the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute closed the book from which they had been reading, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t going to ride to-day,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; Chris proposed. &ldquo;You stay here. I&rsquo;ll be down and back in no
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going for the mail?&rdquo; the voice insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Martin?&rdquo; Lute called, lifting her voice in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; came the voice. &ldquo;I think Robert took him along somewhere&mdash;horse-buying,
      or fishing, or I don&rsquo;t know what. There&rsquo;s really nobody left but Chris and
      you. Besides, it will give you an appetite for dinner. You&rsquo;ve been
      lounging in the hammock all day. And Uncle Robert must have his
      newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Aunty, we&rsquo;re starting,&rdquo; Lute called back, getting out of the
      hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, in riding-clothes, they were saddling the horses.
      They rode out on to the county road, where blazed the afternoon sun, and
      turned toward Glen Ellen. The little town slept in the sun, and the
      somnolent storekeeper and postmaster scarcely kept his eyes open long
      enough to make up the packet of letters and newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Lute and Chris turned aside from the road and dipped along a
      cow-path down the high bank to water the horses, before going into camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dolly looks as though she&rsquo;d forgotten all about yesterday,&rdquo; Chris said,
      as they sat their horses knee-deep in the rushing water. &ldquo;Look at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mare had raised her head and cocked her ears at the rustling of a
      quail in the thicket. Chris leaned over and rubbed around her ears.
      Dolly&rsquo;s enjoyment was evident, and she drooped her head over against the
      shoulder of his own horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a kitten,&rdquo; was Lute&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I shall never be able wholly to trust her again,&rdquo; Chris said. &ldquo;Not
      after yesterday&rsquo;s mad freak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a feeling myself that you are safer on Ban,&rdquo; Lute laughed. &ldquo;It is
      strange. My trust in Dolly is as implicit as ever. I feel confident so far
      as I am concerned, but I should never care to see you on her back again.
      Now with Ban, my faith is still unshaken. Look at that neck! Isn&rsquo;t he
      handsome! He&rsquo;ll be as wise as Dolly when he is as old as she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; Chris laughed back. &ldquo;Ban could never possibly
      betray me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned their horses out of the stream. Dolly stopped to brush a fly
      from her knee with her nose, and Ban urged past into the narrow way of the
      path. The space was too restricted to make him return, save with much
      trouble, and Chris allowed him to go on. Lute, riding behind, dwelt with
      her eyes upon her lover&rsquo;s back, pleasuring in the lines of the bare neck
      and the sweep out to the muscular shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she reined in her horse. She could do nothing but look, so brief
      was the duration of the happening. Beneath and above was the almost
      perpendicular bank. The path itself was barely wide enough for footing.
      Yet Washoe Ban, whirling and rearing at the same time, toppled for a
      moment in the air and fell backward off the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      So unexpected and so quick was it, that the man was involved in the fall.
      There had been no time for him to throw himself to the path. He was
      falling ere he knew it, and he did the only thing possible&mdash;slipped
      the stirrups and threw his body into the air, to the side, and at the same
      time down. It was twelve feet to the rocks below. He maintained an upright
      position, his head up and his eyes fixed on the horse above him and
      falling upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris struck like a cat, on his feet, on the instant making a leap to the
      side. The next instant Ban crashed down beside him. The animal struggled
      little, but sounded the terrible cry that horses sometimes sound when they
      have received mortal hurt. He had struck almost squarely on his back, and
      in that position he remained, his head twisted partly under, his hind legs
      relaxed and motionless, his fore legs futilely striking the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris looked up reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am getting used to it,&rdquo; Lute smiled down to him. &ldquo;Of course I need not
      ask if you are hurt. Can I do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled back and went over to the fallen beast, letting go the girths of
      the saddle and getting the head straightened out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; he said, after a cursory examination. &ldquo;I thought so at the
      time. Did you hear that sort of crunching snap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was the punctuation of life, the final period dropped at the
      end of Ban&rsquo;s usefulness.&rdquo; He started around to come up by the path. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been astride of Ban for the last time. Let us go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the bank Chris turned and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Washoe Ban!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Good-by, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The animal was struggling to lift its head. There were tears in Chris&rsquo;s
      eyes as he turned abruptly away, and tears in Lute&rsquo;s eyes as they met his.
      She was silent in her sympathy, though the pressure of her hand was firm
      in his as he walked beside her horse down the dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was done deliberately,&rdquo; Chris burst forth suddenly. &ldquo;There was no
      warning. He deliberately flung himself over backward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no warning,&rdquo; Lute concurred. &ldquo;I was looking. I saw him. He
      whirled and threw himself at the same time, just as if you had done it
      yourself, with a tremendous jerk and backward pull on the bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not my hand, I swear it. I was not even thinking of him. He was
      going up with a fairly loose rein, as a matter of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have seen it, had you done it,&rdquo; Lute said. &ldquo;But it was all done
      before you had a chance to do anything. It was not your hand, not even
      your unconscious hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was some invisible hand, reaching out from I don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up whimsically at the sky and smiled at the conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martin stepped forward to receive Dolly, when they came into the stable
      end of the grove, but his face expressed no surprise at sight of Chris
      coming in on foot. Chris lingered behind Lute for moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you shoot a horse?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom nodded, then added, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; with a second and deeper nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw a line from the eyes to the ears&mdash;I mean the opposite ears,
      sir. And where the lines cross&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; Chris interrupted. &ldquo;You know the watering place at the
      second bend. You&rsquo;ll find Ban there with a broken back.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    *       *       *
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are, sir. I have been looking for you everywhere since
      dinner. You are wanted immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris tossed his cigar away, then went over and pressed his foot on its
      glowing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told anybody about it?&mdash;Ban?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute shook her head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll learn soon enough. Martin will mention it to
      Uncle Robert tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t feel too bad about it,&rdquo; she said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
      slipping her hand into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my colt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody has ridden him but you. I broke him
      myself. I knew him from the time he was born. I knew every bit of him,
      every trick, every caper, and I would have staked my life that it was
      impossible for him to do a thing like this. There was no warning, no
      fighting for the bit, no previous unruliness. I have been thinking it
      over. He didn&rsquo;t fight for the bit, for that matter. He wasn&rsquo;t unruly, nor
      disobedient. There wasn&rsquo;t time. It was an impulse, and he acted upon it
      like lightning. I am astounded now at the swiftness with which it took
      place. Inside the first second we were over the edge and falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was deliberate&mdash;deliberate suicide. And attempted murder. It was
      a trap. I was the victim. He had me, and he threw himself over with me.
      Yet he did not hate me. He loved me... as much as it is possible for a
      horse to love. I am confounded. I cannot understand it any more than you
      can understand Dolly&rsquo;s behavior yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But horses go insane, Chris,&rdquo; Lute said. &ldquo;You know that. It&rsquo;s merely
      coincidence that two horses in two days should have spells under you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only explanation,&rdquo; he answered, starting off with her. &ldquo;But
      why am I wanted urgently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planchette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I remember. It will be a new experience to me. Somehow I missed it
      when it was all the rage long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did all of us,&rdquo; Lute replied, &ldquo;except Mrs. Grantly. It is her favorite
      phantom, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A weird little thing,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Bundle of nerves and black eyes.
      I&rsquo;ll wager she doesn&rsquo;t weigh ninety pounds, and most of that&rsquo;s magnetism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively uncanny... at times.&rdquo; Lute shivered involuntarily. &ldquo;She gives
      me the creeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contact of the healthy with the morbid,&rdquo; he explained dryly. &ldquo;You will
      notice it is the healthy that always has the creeps. The morbid never has
      the creeps. It gives the creeps. That&rsquo;s its function. Where did you people
      pick her up, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yes, I do, too. Aunt Mildred met her in Boston, I
      think&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know. At any rate, Mrs. Grantly came to
      California, and of course had to visit Aunt Mildred. You know the open
      house we keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They halted where a passageway between two great redwood trunks gave
      entrance to the dining room. Above, through lacing boughs, could be seen
      the stars. Candles lighted the tree-columned space. About the table,
      examining the Planchette contrivance, were four persons. Chris&rsquo;s gaze
      roved over them, and he was aware of a guilty sorrow-pang as he paused for
      a moment on Lute&rsquo;s Aunt Mildred and Uncle Robert, mellow with ripe middle
      age and genial with the gentle buffets life had dealt them. He passed
      amusedly over the black-eyed, frail-bodied Mrs. Grantly, and halted on the
      fourth person, a portly, massive-headed man, whose gray temples belied the
      youthful solidity of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chris whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Mr. Barton. The train was late. That&rsquo;s why you didn&rsquo;t see him at
      dinner. He&rsquo;s only a capitalist&mdash;water-power-long-distance-electricity
      transmitter, or something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look as though he could give an ox points on imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t. He inherited his money. But he knows enough to hold on to it
      and hire other men&rsquo;s brains. He is very conservative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to be expected,&rdquo; was Chris&rsquo;s comment. His gaze went back to the
      man and woman who had been father and mother to the girl beside him. &ldquo;Do
      you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it came to me with a shock yesterday when you told me
      that they had turned against me and that I was scarcely tolerated. I met
      them afterwards, last evening, guiltily, in fear and trembling&mdash;and
      to-day, too. And yet I could see no difference from of old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear man,&rdquo; Lute sighed. &ldquo;Hospitality is as natural to them as the act of
      breathing. But it isn&rsquo;t that, after all. It is all genuine in their dear
      hearts. No matter how severe the censure they put upon you when you are
      absent, the moment they are with you they soften and are all kindness and
      warmth. As soon as their eyes rest on you, affection and love come
      bubbling up. You are so made. Every animal likes you. All people like you.
      They can&rsquo;t help it. You can&rsquo;t help it. You are universally lovable, and
      the best of it is that you don&rsquo;t know it. You don&rsquo;t know it now. Even as I
      tell it to you, you don&rsquo;t realize it, you won&rsquo;t realize it&mdash;and that
      very incapacity to realize it is one of the reasons why you are so loved.
      You are incredulous now, and you shake your head; but I know, who am your
      slave, as all people know, for they likewise are your slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in a minute we shall go in and join them. Mark the affection, almost
      maternal, that will well up in Aunt Mildred&rsquo;s eyes. Listen to the tones of
      Uncle Robert&rsquo;s voice when he says, &lsquo;Well, Chris, my boy?&rsquo; Watch Mrs.
      Grantly melt, literally melt, like a dewdrop in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Mr. Barton, there. You have never seen him before. Why, you will
      invite him out to smoke a cigar with you when the rest of us have gone to
      bed&mdash;you, a mere nobody, and he a man of many millions, a man of
      power, a man obtuse and stupid like the ox; and he will follow you about,
      smoking; the cigar, like a little dog, your little dog, trotting at your
      back. He will not know he is doing it, but he will be doing it just the
      same. Don&rsquo;t I know, Chris? Oh, I have watched you, watched you, so often,
      and loved you for it, and loved you again for it, because you were so
      delightfully and blindly unaware of what you were doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost bursting with vanity from listening to you,&rdquo; he laughed,
      passing his arm around her and drawing her against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and in this very moment, when you are laughing at
      all that I have said, you, the feel of you, your soul,&mdash;call it what
      you will, it is you,&mdash;is calling for all the love that is in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned more closely against him, and sighed as with fatigue. He
      breathed a kiss into her hair and held her with firm tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Mildred stirred briskly and looked up from the Planchette board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us begin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will soon grow chilly. Robert, where
      are those children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Lute called out, disengaging herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for a bundle of creeps,&rdquo; Chris whispered, as they started in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute&rsquo;s prophecy of the manner in which her lover would be received was
      realized. Mrs. Grantly, unreal, unhealthy, scintillant with frigid
      magnetism, warmed and melted as though of truth she were dew and he sun.
      Mr. Barton beamed broadly upon him, and was colossally gracious. Aunt
      Mildred greeted him with a glow of fondness and motherly kindness, while
      Uncle Robert genially and heartily demanded, &ldquo;Well, Chris, my boy, and
      what of the riding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Mildred drew her shawl more closely around her and hastened them
      to the business in hand. On the table was a sheet of paper. On the paper,
      rifling on three supports, was a small triangular board. Two of the
      supports were easily moving casters. The third support, placed at the apex
      of the triangle, was a lead pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s first?&rdquo; Uncle Robert demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s hesitancy, then Aunt Mildred placed her hand on the
      board, and said: &ldquo;Some one has always to be the fool for the delectation
      of the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave woman,&rdquo; applauded her husband. &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Grantly, do your worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; that lady queried. &ldquo;I do nothing. The power, or whatever you care to
      think it, is outside of me, as it is outside of all of you. As to what
      that power is, I will not dare to say. There is such a power. I have had
      evidences of it. And you will undoubtedly have evidences of it. Now please
      be quiet, everybody. Touch the board very lightly, but firmly, Mrs. Story;
      but do nothing of your own volition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Mildred nodded, and stood with her hand on Planchette; while the rest
      formed about her in a silent and expectant circle. But nothing happened.
      The minutes ticked away, and Planchette remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly counselled. &ldquo;Do not struggle against any
      influences you may feel working on you. But do not do anything yourself.
      The influence will take care of that. You will feel impelled to do things,
      and such impulses will be practically irresistible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the influence would hurry up,&rdquo; Aunt Mildred protested at the end
      of five motionless minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little longer, Mrs. Story, just a little longer,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly
      said soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Aunt Mildred&rsquo;s hand began to twitch into movement. A mild concern
      showed in her face as she observed the movement of her hand and heard the
      scratching of the pencil-point at the apex of Planchette.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another five minutes this continued, when Aunt Mildred withdrew her
      hand with an effort, and said, with a nervous laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I did it myself or not. I do know that I was growing
      nervous, standing there like a psychic fool with all your solemn faces
      turned upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hen-scratches,&rdquo; was Uncle Robert&rsquo;s judgement, when he looked over the
      paper upon which she had scrawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite illegible,&rdquo; was Mrs. Grantly&rsquo;s dictum. &ldquo;It does not resemble
      writing at all. The influences have not got to working yet. Do you try it,
      Mr. Barton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman stepped forward, ponderously willing to please, and placed
      his hand on the board. And for ten solid, stolid minutes he stood there,
      motionless, like a statue, the frozen personification of the commercial
      age. Uncle Robert&rsquo;s face began to work. He blinked, stiffened his mouth,
      uttered suppressed, throaty sounds, deep down; finally he snorted, lost
      his self-control, and broke out in a roar of laughter. All joined in this
      merriment, including Mrs. Grantly. Mr. Barton laughed with them, but he
      was vaguely nettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You try it, Story,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Robert, still laughing, and urged on by Lute and his wife, took the
      board. Suddenly his face sobered. His hand had begun to move, and the
      pencil could be heard scratching across the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s curious. Look at it. I&rsquo;m not doing it. I
      know I&rsquo;m not doing it. Look at that hand go! Just look at it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Robert, none of your ridiculousness,&rdquo; his wife warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m not doing it,&rdquo; he replied indignantly. &ldquo;The force has got
      hold of me. Ask Mrs. Grantly. Tell her to make it stop, if you want it to
      stop. I can&rsquo;t stop it. By George! look at that flourish. I didn&rsquo;t do that.
      I never wrote a flourish in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do try to be serious,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly warned them. &ldquo;An atmosphere of levity
      does not conduce to the best operation of Planchette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that will do, I guess,&rdquo; Uncle Robert said as he took his hand
      away. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over and adjusted his glasses. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s handwriting at any rate, and
      that&rsquo;s better than the rest of you did. Here, Lute, your eyes are young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what flourishes!&rdquo; Lute exclaimed, as she looked at the paper. &ldquo;And
      look there, there are two different handwritings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to read: &ldquo;This is the first lecture. Concentrate on this
      sentence: &lsquo;I am a positive spirit and not negative to any condition.&rsquo; Then
      follow with concentration on positive love. After that peace and harmony
      will vibrate through and around your body. Your soul&mdash;The other
      writing breaks right in. This is the way it goes: Bullfrog 95, Dixie 16,
      Golden Anchor 65, Gold Mountain 13, Jim Butler 70, Jumbo 75, North Star
      42, Rescue 7, Black Butte 75, Brown Hope 16, Iron Top 3.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iron Top&rsquo;s pretty low,&rdquo; Mr. Barton murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert, you&rsquo;ve been dabbling again!&rdquo; Aunt Mildred cried accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; he denied. &ldquo;I only read the quotations. But how the devil&mdash;I
      beg your pardon&mdash;they got there on that piece of paper I&rsquo;d like to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your subconscious mind,&rdquo; Chris suggested. &ldquo;You read the quotations in
      to-day&rsquo;s paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t; but last week I glanced over the column.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day or a year is all the same in the subconscious mind,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Grantly. &ldquo;The subconscious mind never forgets. But I am not saying that
      this is due to the subconscious mind. I refuse to state to what I think it
      is due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about that other stuff?&rdquo; Uncle Robert demanded. &ldquo;Sounds like what
      I&rsquo;d think Christian Science ought to sound like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or theosophy,&rdquo; Aunt Mildred volunteered. &ldquo;Some message to a neophyte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, read the rest,&rdquo; her husband commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This puts you in touch with the mightier spirits,&rdquo; Lute read. &ldquo;You shall
      become one with us, and your name shall be &lsquo;Arya,&rsquo; and you shall&mdash;Conqueror
      20, Empire 12, Columbia Mountain 18, Midway 140&mdash;and, and that is
      all. Oh, no! here&rsquo;s a last flourish, Arya, from Kandor&mdash;that must
      surely be the Mahatma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you explain that theosophy stuff on the basis of the
      subconscious mind, Chris,&rdquo; Uncle Robert challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;No explanation. You must have got a message
      intended for some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lines were crossed, eh?&rdquo; Uncle Robert chuckled. &ldquo;Multiplex spiritual
      wireless telegraphy, I&rsquo;d call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS nonsense,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly said. &ldquo;I never knew Planchette to behave so
      outrageously. There are disturbing influences at work. I felt them from
      the first. Perhaps it is because you are all making too much fun of it.
      You are too hilarious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain befitting gravity should grace the occasion,&rdquo; Chris agreed,
      placing his hand on Planchette. &ldquo;Let me try. And not one of you must laugh
      or giggle, or even think &lsquo;laugh&rsquo; or &lsquo;giggle.&rsquo; And if you dare to snort,
      even once, Uncle Robert, there is no telling what occult vengeance may be
      wreaked upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be good,&rdquo; Uncle Robert rejoined. &ldquo;But if I really must snort, may I
      silently slip away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris nodded. His hand had already begun to work. There had been no
      preliminary twitchings nor tentative essays at writing. At once his hand
      had started off, and Planchette was moving swiftly and smoothly across the
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him,&rdquo; Lute whispered to her aunt. &ldquo;See how white he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris betrayed disturbance at the sound of her voice, and thereafter
      silence was maintained. Only could be heard the steady scratching of the
      pencil. Suddenly, as though it had been stung, he jerked his hand away.
      With a sigh and a yawn he stepped back from the table, then glanced with
      the curiosity of a newly awakened man at their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I wrote something,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say you did,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly remarked with satisfaction, holding
      up the sheet of paper and glancing at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it aloud,&rdquo; Uncle Robert said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is, then. It begins with &lsquo;beware&rsquo; written three times, and in
      much larger characters than the rest of the writing. BEWARE! BEWARE!
      BEWARE! Chris Dunbar, I intend to destroy you. I have already made two
      attempts upon your life, and failed. I shall yet succeed. So sure am I
      that I shall succeed that I dare to tell you. I do not need to tell you
      why. In your own heart you know. The wrong you are doing&mdash;And here it
      abruptly ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grantly laid the paper down on the table and looked at Chris, who had
      already become the centre of all eyes, and who was yawning as from an
      overpowering drowsiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a sanguinary turn, I should say,&rdquo; Uncle Robert remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already made two attempts upon your life,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly read from
      the paper, which she was going over a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my life?&rdquo; Chris demanded between yawns. &ldquo;Why, my life hasn&rsquo;t been
      attempted even once. My! I am sleepy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my boy, you are thinking of flesh-and-blood men,&rdquo; Uncle Robert
      laughed. &ldquo;But this is a spirit. Your life has been attempted by unseen
      things. Most likely ghostly hands have tried to throttle you in your
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Chris!&rdquo; Lute cried impulsively. &ldquo;This afternoon! The hand you said
      must have seized your rein!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was joking,&rdquo; he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless...&rdquo; Lute left her thought unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grantly had become keen on the scent. &ldquo;What was that about this
      afternoon? Was your life in danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris&rsquo;s drowsiness had disappeared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m becoming interested myself,&rdquo; he
      acknowledged. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t said anything about it. Ban broke his back this
      afternoon. He threw himself off the bank, and I ran the risk of being
      caught underneath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, I wonder,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly communed aloud. &ldquo;There is something in
      this.... It is a warning.... Ah! You were hurt yesterday riding Miss
      Story&rsquo;s horse! That makes the two attempts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked triumphantly at them. Planchette had been vindicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; laughed Uncle Robert, but with a slight hint of irritation in
      his manner. &ldquo;Such things do not happen these days. This is the twentieth
      century, my dear madam. The thing, at the very latest, smacks of
      mediaevalism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had such wonderful tests with Planchette,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly began,
      then broke off suddenly to go to the table and place her hand on the
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The board immediately began to write. By this time all heads, with the
      exception of Mr. Barton&rsquo;s, were bent over the table and following the
      pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dick,&rdquo; Aunt Mildred cried, a note of the mildly hysterical in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband straightened up, his face for the first time grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dick&rsquo;s signature,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know his fist in a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dick Curtis,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly read aloud. &ldquo;Who is Dick Curtis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, that&rsquo;s remarkable!&rdquo; Mr. Barton broke in. &ldquo;The handwriting in
      both instances is the same. Clever, I should say, really clever,&rdquo; he added
      admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; Uncle Robert demanded, taking the paper and examining it.
      &ldquo;Yes, it is Dick&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is Dick?&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly insisted. &ldquo;Who is this Dick Curtis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick Curtis, why, he was Captain Richard Curtis,&rdquo; Uncle Robert answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was Lute&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; Aunt Mildred supplemented. &ldquo;Lute took our name.
      She never saw him. He died when she was a few weeks old. He was my
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable, most remarkable.&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly was revolving the message in
      her mind. &ldquo;There were two attempts on Mr. Dunbar&rsquo;s life. The subconscious
      mind cannot explain that, for none of us knew of the accident to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; Chris answered, &ldquo;and it was I that operated Planchette. The
      explanation is simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the handwriting,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Barton. &ldquo;What you wrote and what
      Mrs. Grantly wrote are identical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris bent over and compared the handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly cried, &ldquo;Mr. Story recognizes the handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for verification.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded his head. &ldquo;Yes, it is Dick&rsquo;s fist. I&rsquo;ll swear to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to Lute had come a visioning. While the rest argued pro and con and
      the air was filled with phrases,&mdash;&ldquo;psychic phenomena,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;self-hypnotism,&rdquo; &ldquo;residuum of unexplained truth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;spiritism,&rdquo;&mdash;she
      was reviving mentally the girlhood pictures she had conjured of this
      soldier-father she had never seen. She possessed his sword, there were
      several old-fashioned daguerreotypes, there was much that had been said of
      him, stories told of him&mdash;and all this had constituted the material
      out of which she had builded him in her childhood fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the possibility of one mind unconsciously suggesting to another
      mind,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly was saying; but through Lute&rsquo;s mind was trooping her
      father on his great roan war-horse. Now he was leading his men. She saw
      him on lonely scouts, or in the midst of the yelling, Indians at Salt
      Meadows, when of his command he returned with one man in ten. And in the
      picture she had of him, in the physical semblance she had made of him, was
      reflected his spiritual nature, reflected by her worshipful artistry in
      form and feature and expression&mdash;his bravery, his quick temper, his
      impulsive championship, his madness of wrath in a righteous cause, his
      warm generosity and swift forgiveness, and his chivalry that epitomized
      codes and ideals primitive as the days of knighthood. And first, last, and
      always, dominating all, she saw in the face of him the hot passion and
      quickness of deed that had earned for him the name &ldquo;Fighting Dick Curtis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me put it to the test,&rdquo; she heard Mrs. Grantly saying. &ldquo;Let Miss
      Story try Planchette. There may be a further message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I beg of you,&rdquo; Aunt Mildred interposed. &ldquo;It is too uncanny. It
      surely is wrong to tamper with the dead. Besides, I am nervous. Or,
      better, let me go to bed, leaving you to go on with your experiments. That
      will be the best way, and you can tell me in the morning.&rdquo; Mingled with
      the &ldquo;Good-nights,&rdquo; were half-hearted protests from Mrs. Grantly, as Aunt
      Mildred withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert can return,&rdquo; she called back, &ldquo;as soon as he has seen me to my
      tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a shame to give it up now,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly said. &ldquo;There is no
      telling what we are on the verge of. Won&rsquo;t you try it, Miss Story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute obeyed, but when she placed her hand on the board she was conscious
      of a vague and nameless fear at this toying with the supernatural. She was
      twentieth-century, and the thing in essence, as her uncle had said, was
      mediaeval. Yet she could not shake off the instinctive fear that arose in
      her&mdash;man&rsquo;s inheritance from the wild and howling ages when his hairy,
      apelike prototype was afraid of the dark and personified the elements into
      things of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the mysterious influence seized her hand and sent it meriting
      across the paper, all the unusual passed out of the situation and she was
      unaware of more than a feeble curiosity. For she was intent on another
      visioning&mdash;this time of her mother, who was also unremembered in the
      flesh. Not sharp and vivid like that of her father, but dim and nebulous
      was the picture she shaped of her mother&mdash;a saint&rsquo;s head in an
      aureole of sweetness and goodness and meekness, and withal, shot through
      with a hint of reposeful determination, of will, stubborn and unobtrusive,
      that in life had expressed itself mainly in resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute&rsquo;s hand had ceased moving, and Mrs. Grantly was already reading the
      message that had been written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a different handwriting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s hand. &lsquo;Martha,&rsquo; it
      is signed. Who is Martha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute was not surprised. &ldquo;It is my mother,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;What does she
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not been made sleepy, as Chris had; but the keen edge of her
      vitality had been blunted, and she was experiencing a sweet and pleasing
      lassitude. And while the message was being read, in her eyes persisted the
      vision of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly read, &ldquo;do not mind him. He was ever quick of
      speech and rash. Be no niggard with your love. Love cannot hurt you. To
      deny love is to sin. Obey your heart and you can do no wrong. Obey worldly
      considerations, obey pride, obey those that prompt you against your
      heart&rsquo;s prompting, and you do sin. Do not mind your father. He is angry
      now, as was his way in the earth-life; but he will come to see the wisdom
      of my counsel, for this, too, was his way in the earth-life. Love, my
      child, and love well.&mdash;Martha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see it,&rdquo; Lute cried, seizing the paper and devouring the
      handwriting with her eyes. She was thrilling with unexpressed love for the
      mother she had never seen, and this written speech from the grave seemed
      to give more tangibility to her having ever existed, than did the vision
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This IS remarkable,&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly was reiterating. &ldquo;There was never
      anything like it. Think of it, my dear, both your father and mother here
      with us tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute shivered. The lassitude was gone, and she was her natural self again,
      vibrant with the instinctive fear of things unseen. And it was offensive
      to her mind that, real or illusion, the presence or the memorized
      existences of her father and mother should be touched by these two persons
      who were practically strangers&mdash;Mrs. Grantly, unhealthy and morbid,
      and Mr. Barton, stolid and stupid with a grossness both of the flesh and
      the spirit. And it further seemed a trespass that these strangers should
      thus enter into the intimacy between her and Chris.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hear the steps of her uncle approaching, and the situation
      flashed upon her, luminous and clear. She hurriedly folded the sheet of
      paper and thrust it into her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything to him about this second message, Mrs. Grantly,
      please, and Mr. Barton. Nor to Aunt Mildred. It would only cause them
      irritation and needless anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her mind there was also the desire to protect her lover, for she knew
      that the strain of his present standing with her aunt and uncle would be
      added to, unconsciously in their minds, by the weird message of
      Planchette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please don&rsquo;t let us have any more Planchette,&rdquo; Lute continued
      hastily. &ldquo;Let us forget all the nonsense that has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; my dear child?&rdquo; Mrs. Grantly was indignantly protesting when
      Uncle Robert strode into the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s being done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; Lute answered lightly. &ldquo;No more stock quotations for you.
      Planchette is adjourned, and we&rsquo;re just winding up the discussion of the
      theory of it. Do you know how late it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    *       *       *
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did you do last night after we left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, took a stroll,&rdquo; Chris answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute&rsquo;s eyes were quizzical as she asked with a tentativeness that was
      palpably assumed, &ldquo;With&mdash;a&mdash;with Mr. Barton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and now what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lute broke into merry laughter. &ldquo;Just as I told you that you would do. Am
      I not a prophet? But I knew before I saw you that my forecast had come
      true. I have just left Mr. Barton, and I knew he had walked with you last
      night, for he is vowing by all his fetishes and idols that you are a
      perfectly splendid young man. I could see it with my eyes shut. The Chris
      Dunbar glamour has fallen upon him. But I have not finished the catechism
      by any means. Where have you been all morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I am going to take you this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You plan well without knowing my wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew well what your wishes are. It is to see a horse I have found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice betrayed her delight, as she cried, &ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a beauty,&rdquo; Chris said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her face had suddenly gone grave, and apprehension brooded in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s called Comanche,&rdquo; Chris went on. &ldquo;A beauty, a regular beauty, the
      perfect type of the Californian cow-pony. And his lines&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s
      the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us ride any more,&rdquo; Lute said, &ldquo;at least for a while. Really, I
      think I am a tiny bit tired of it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her in astonishment, and she was bravely meeting his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see hearses and flowers for you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and a funeral oration; I
      see the end of the world, and the stars falling out of the sky, and the
      heavens rolling up as a scroll; I see the living and the dead gathered
      together for the final judgement, the sheep and the goats, the lambs and
      the rams and all the rest of it, the white-robed saints, the sound of
      golden harps, and the lost souls howling as they fall into the Pit&mdash;all
      this I see on the day that you, Lute Story, no longer care to ride a
      horse. A horse, Lute! a horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while, at least,&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Aren&rsquo;t you well?&mdash;you who
      are always so abominably and adorably well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I know it is ridiculous, Chris, I know
      it, but the doubt will arise. I cannot help it. You always say I am so
      sanely rooted to the earth and reality and all that, but&mdash;perhaps
      it&rsquo;s superstition, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but the whole occurrence, the
      messages of Planchette, the possibility of my father&rsquo;s hand, I know not
      how, reaching, out to Ban&rsquo;s rein and hurling him and you to death, the
      correspondence between my father&rsquo;s statement that he has twice attempted
      your life and the fact that in the last two days your life has twice been
      endangered by horses&mdash;my father was a great horseman&mdash;all this,
      I say, causes the doubt to arise in my mind. What if there be something in
      it? I am not so sure. Science may be too dogmatic in its denial of the
      unseen. The forces of the unseen, of the spirit, may well be too subtle,
      too sublimated, for science to lay hold of, and recognize, and formulate.
      Don&rsquo;t you see, Chris, that there is rationality in the very doubt? It may
      be a very small doubt&mdash;oh, so small; but I love you too much to run
      even that slight risk. Besides, I am a woman, and that should in itself
      fully account for my predisposition toward superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, call it unreality. But I&rsquo;ve heard you paradoxing upon
      the reality of the unreal&mdash;the reality of delusion to the mind that
      is sick. And so with me, if you will; it is delusion and unreal, but to
      me, constituted as I am, it is very real&mdash;is real as a nightmare is
      real, in the throes of it, before one awakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most logical argument for illogic I have ever heard,&rdquo; Chris smiled.
      &ldquo;It is a good gaming proposition, at any rate. You manage to embrace more
      chances in your philosophy than do I in mine. It reminds me of Sam&mdash;the
      gardener you had a couple of years ago. I overheard him and Martin arguing
      in the stable. You know what a bigoted atheist Martin is. Well, Martin had
      deluged Sam with floods of logic. Sam pondered awhile, and then he said,
      &lsquo;Foh a fack, Mis&rsquo; Martin, you jis&rsquo; tawk like a house afire; but you ain&rsquo;t
      got de show I has.&rsquo; &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; Martin asked. &lsquo;Well, you see, Mis&rsquo; 
      Martin, you has one chance to mah two.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rsquo; Martin said.
      &lsquo;Mis&rsquo; Martin, it&rsquo;s dis way. You has jis&rsquo; de chance, lak you say, to become
      worms foh de fruitification of de cabbage garden. But I&rsquo;s got de chance to
      lif&rsquo; mah voice to de glory of de Lawd as I go paddin&rsquo; dem golden streets&mdash;along
      &lsquo;ith de chance to be jis&rsquo; worms along &lsquo;ith you, Mis&rsquo; Martin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to take me seriously,&rdquo; Lute said, when she had laughed her
      appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I take that Planchette rigmarole seriously?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t explain it&mdash;the handwriting of my father, which Uncle
      Robert recognized&mdash;oh, the whole thing, you don&rsquo;t explain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know all the mysteries of mind,&rdquo; Chris answered. &ldquo;But I believe
      such phenomena will all yield to scientific explanation in the not distant
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same, I have a sneaking desire to find out some more from
      Planchette,&rdquo; Lute confessed. &ldquo;The board is still down in the dining room.
      We could try it now, you and I, and no one would know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris caught her hand, crying: &ldquo;Come on! It will be a lark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hand in hand they ran down the path to the tree-pillared room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The camp is deserted,&rdquo; Lute said, as she placed Planchette on the table.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Grantly and Aunt Mildred are lying down, and Mr. Barton has gone off
      with Uncle Robert. There is nobody to disturb us.&rdquo; She placed her hand on
      the board. &ldquo;Now begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes nothing happened. Chris started to speak, but she hushed
      him to silence. The preliminary twitchings had appeared in her hand and
      arm. Then the pencil began to write. They read the message, word by word,
      as it was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      There is wisdom greater than the wisdom of reason. Love proceeds not out
      of the dry-as-dust way of the mind. Love is of the heart, and is beyond
      all reason, and logic, and philosophy. Trust your own heart, my daughter.
      And if your heart bids you have faith in your lover, then laugh at the
      mind and its cold wisdom, and obey your heart, and have faith in your
      lover.&mdash;Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that whole message is the dictate of your own heart,&rdquo; Chris cried.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Lute? The thought is your very own, and your subconscious
      mind has expressed it there on the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is one thing I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the handwriting. Look at it. It does not resemble mine at all. It is
      mincing, it is old-fashioned, it is the old-fashioned feminine of a
      generation ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that you really believe that this is a
      message from the dead?&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Chris,&rdquo; she wavered. &ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absurd!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;These are cobwebs of fancy. When one dies, he
      is dead. He is dust. He goes to the worms, as Martin says. The dead? I
      laugh at the dead. They do not exist. They are not. I defy the powers of
      the grave, the men dead and dust and gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you to say to that?&rdquo; he challenged, placing his hand on
      Planchette.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the instant his hand began to write. Both were startled by the
      suddenness of it. The message was brief:
    </p>
    <p>
      BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was distinctly sobered, but he laughed. &ldquo;It is like a miracle play.
      Death we have, speaking to us from the grave. But Good Deeds, where art
      thou? And Kindred? and Joy? and Household Goods? and Friendship? and all
      the goodly company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lute did not share his bravado. Her fright showed itself in her face.
      She laid her trembling hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Chris, let us stop. I am sorry we began it. Let us leave the quiet
      dead to their rest. It is wrong. It must be wrong. I confess I am affected
      by it. I cannot help it. As my body is trembling, so is my soul. This
      speech of the grave, this dead man reaching out from the mould of a
      generation to protect me from you. There is reason in it. There is the
      living mystery that prevents you from marrying me. Were my father alive,
      he would protect me from you. Dead, he still strives to protect me. His
      hands, his ghostly hands, are against your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be calm,&rdquo; Chris said soothingly. &ldquo;Listen to me. It is all a lark. We
      are playing with the subjective forces of our own being, with phenomena
      which science has not yet explained, that is all. Psychology is so young a
      science. The subconscious mind has just been discovered, one might say. It
      is all mystery as yet; the laws of it are yet to be formulated. This is
      simply unexplained phenomena. But that is no reason that we should
      immediately account for it by labelling it spiritism. As yet we do not
      know, that is all. As for Planchette&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He abruptly ceased, for at that moment, to enforce his remark, he had
      placed his hand on Planchette, and at that moment his hand had been
      seized, as by a paroxysm, and sent dashing, willy-nilly, across the paper,
      writing as the hand of an angry person would write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care for any more of it,&rdquo; Lute said, when the message was
      completed. &ldquo;It is like witnessing a fight between you and my father in the
      flesh. There is the savor in it of struggle and blows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed out a sentence that read: &ldquo;You cannot escape me nor the just
      punishment that is yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I visualize too vividly for my own comfort, for I can see his
      hands at your throat. I know that he is, as you say, dead and dust, but
      for all that, I can see him as a man that is alive and walks the earth; I
      see the anger in his face, the anger and the vengeance, and I see it all
      directed against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crumpled up the scrawled sheets of paper, and put Planchette away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t bother with it any more,&rdquo; Chris said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would
      affect you so strongly. But it&rsquo;s all subjective, I&rsquo;m sure, with possibly a
      bit of suggestion thrown in&mdash;that and nothing more. And the whole
      strain of our situation has made conditions unusually favorable for
      striking phenomena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about our situation,&rdquo; Lute said, as they went slowly up the path they
      had run down. &ldquo;What we are to do, I don&rsquo;t know. Are we to go on, as we
      have gone on? What is best? Have you thought of anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He debated for a few steps. &ldquo;I have thought of telling your uncle and
      aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you couldn&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered slowly; &ldquo;but just as much as I have told you. I have no
      right to tell them more than I have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time it was she that debated. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t tell them,&rdquo; she said
      finally. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t understand. I don&rsquo;t understand, for that matter,
      but I have faith in you, and in the nature of things they are not capable
      of this same implicit faith. You raise up before me a mystery that
      prevents our marriage, and I believe you; but they could not believe you
      without doubts arising as to the wrong and ill-nature of the mystery.
      Besides, it would but make their anxieties greater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should go away, I know I should go away,&rdquo; he said, half under his
      breath. &ldquo;And I can. I am no weakling. Because I have failed to remain away
      once, is no reason that I shall fail again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath with a quick gasp. &ldquo;It is like a bereavement to hear
      you speak of going away and remaining away. I should never see you again.
      It is too terrible. And do not reproach yourself for weakness. It is I who
      am to blame. It is I who prevented you from remaining away before, I know.
      I wanted you so. I want you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to be done, Chris, nothing to be done but to go on with
      it and let it work itself out somehow. That is one thing we are sure of:
      it will work out somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be easier if I went away,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happier when you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cruelty of circumstance,&rdquo; he muttered savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go or stay&mdash;that will be part of the working out. But I do not want
      you to go, Chris; you know that. And now no more about it. Talk cannot
      mend it. Let us never mention it again&mdash;unless... unless some time,
      some wonderful, happy time, you can come to me and say: &lsquo;Lute, all is well
      with me. The mystery no longer binds me. I am free.&rsquo; Until that time let
      us bury it, along with Planchette and all the rest, and make the most of
      the little that is given us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, to show you how prepared I am to make the most of that little, I
      am even ready to go with you this afternoon to see the horse&mdash;though
      I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t ride any more... for a few days, anyway, or for a
      week. What did you say was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comanche,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I know you will like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      Chris lay on his back, his head propped by the bare jutting wall of stone,
      his gaze attentively directed across the canyon to the opposing
      tree-covered slope. There was a sound of crashing through underbrush, the
      ringing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and an occasional and mossy descent
      of a dislodged boulder that bounded from the hill and fetched up with a
      final splash in the torrent that rushed over a wild chaos of rocks beneath
      him. Now and again he caught glimpses, framed in green foliage, of the
      golden brown of Lute&rsquo;s corduroy riding-habit and of the bay horse that
      moved beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rode out into an open space where a loose earth-slide denied lodgement
      to trees and grass. She halted the horse at the brink of the slide and
      glanced down it with a measuring eye. Forty feet beneath, the slide
      terminated in a small, firm-surfaced terrace, the banked accumulation of
      fallen earth and gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good test,&rdquo; she called across the canyon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put him
      down it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The animal gingerly launched himself on the treacherous footing,
      irregularly losing and gaining his hind feet, keeping his fore legs stiff,
      and steadily and calmly, without panic or nervousness, extricating the
      fore feet as fast as they sank too deep into the sliding earth that surged
      along in a wave before him. When the firm footing at the bottom was
      reached, he strode out on the little terrace with a quickness and
      springiness of gait and with glintings of muscular fires that gave the lie
      to the calm deliberation of his movements on the slide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Chris shouted across the canyon, clapping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wisest-footed, clearest-headed horse I ever saw,&rdquo; Lute called back,
      as she turned the animal to the side and dropped down a broken slope of
      rubble and into the trees again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris followed her by the sound of her progress, and by occasional
      glimpses where the foliage was more open, as she zigzagged down the steep
      and trailless descent. She emerged below him at the rugged rim of the
      torrent, dropped the horse down a three-foot wall, and halted to study the
      crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four feet out in the stream, a narrow ledge thrust above the surface of
      the water. Beyond the ledge boiled an angry pool. But to the left, from
      the ledge, and several feet lower, was a tiny bed of gravel. A giant
      boulder prevented direct access to the gravel bed. The only way to gain it
      was by first leaping to the ledge of rock. She studied it carefully, and
      the tightening of her bridle-arm advertised that she had made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris, in his anxiety, had sat up to observe more closely what she
      meditated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tackle it,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have faith in Comanche,&rdquo; she called in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t make that side-jump to the gravel,&rdquo; Chris warned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never
      keep his legs. He&rsquo;ll topple over into the pool. Not one horse in a
      thousand could do that stunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Comanche is that very horse,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave the animal his head, and he leaped cleanly and accurately to the
      ledge, striking with feet close together on the narrow space. On the
      instant he struck, Lute lightly touched his neck with the rein, impelling
      him to the left; and in that instant, tottering on the insecure footing,
      with front feet slipping over into the pool beyond, he lifted on his hind
      legs, with a half turn, sprang to the left, and dropped squarely down to
      the tiny gravel bed. An easy jump brought him across the stream, and Lute
      angled him up the bank and halted before her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all tense,&rdquo; Chris answered. &ldquo;I was holding my breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy him, by all means,&rdquo; Lute said, dismounting. &ldquo;He is a bargain. I could
      dare anything on him. I never in my life had such confidence in a horse&rsquo;s
      feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His owner says that he has never been known to lose his feet, that it is
      impossible to get him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy him, buy him at once,&rdquo; she counselled, &ldquo;before the man changes his
      mind. If you don&rsquo;t, I shall. Oh, such feet! I feel such confidence in them
      that when I am on him I don&rsquo;t consider he has feet at all. And he&rsquo;s quick
      as a cat, and instantly obedient. Bridle-wise is no name for it! You could
      guide him with silken threads. Oh, I know I&rsquo;m enthusiastic, but if you
      don&rsquo;t buy him, Chris. I shall. Remember, I&rsquo;ve second refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris smiled agreement as he changed the saddles. Meanwhile she compared
      the two horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he doesn&rsquo;t match Dolly the way Ban did,&rdquo; she concluded
      regretfully; &ldquo;but his coat is splendid just the same. And think of the
      horse that is under the coat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris gave her a hand into the saddle, and followed her up the slope to
      the county road. She reined in suddenly, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go straight back to camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget dinner,&rdquo; he warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I remember Comanche,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ride directly over to the
      ranch and buy him. Dinner will keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the cook won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chris laughed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s already threatened to leave,
      what of our late-comings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Aunt Mildred may have to get another cook, but
      at any rate we shall have got Comanche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned the horses in the other direction, and took the climb of the
      Nun Canyon road that led over the divide and down into the Napa Valley.
      But the climb was hard, the going was slow. Sometimes they topped the bed
      of the torrent by hundreds of feet, and again they dipped down and crossed
      and recrossed it twenty times in twice as many rods. They rode through the
      deep shade of clean-bunked maples and towering redwoods, to emerge on open
      stretches of mountain shoulder where the earth lay dry and cracked under
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one such shoulder they emerged, where the road stretched level before
      them, for a quarter of a mile. On one side rose the huge bulk of the
      mountain. On the other side the steep wall of the canyon fell away in
      impossible slopes and sheer drops to the torrent at the bottom. It was an
      abyss of green beauty and shady depths, pierced by vagrant shafts of the
      sun and mottled here and there by the sun&rsquo;s broader blazes. The sound of
      rushing water ascended on the windless air, and there was a hum of
      mountain bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses broke into an easy lope. Chris rode on the outside, looking
      down into the great depths and pleasuring with his eyes in what he saw.
      Dissociating itself from the murmur of the bees, a murmur arose of falling
      water. It grew louder with every stride of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute leaned well out from her horse to see. Beneath them the water slid
      foaming down a smooth-faced rock to the lip, whence it leaped clear&mdash;a
      pulsating ribbon of white, a-breath with movement, ever falling and ever
      remaining, changing its substance but never its form, an aerial waterway
      as immaterial as gauze and as permanent as the hills, that spanned space
      and the free air from the lip of the rock to the tops of the trees far
      below, into whose green screen it disappeared to fall into a secret pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had flashed past. The descending water became a distant murmur that
      merged again into the murmur of the bees and ceased. Swayed by a common
      impulse, they looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Chris, it is good to be alive... and to have you here by my side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her by the warm light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things tended to key them to an exquisite pitch&mdash;the movement of
      their bodies, at one with the moving bodies of the animals beneath them;
      the gently stimulated blood caressing the flesh through and through with
      the soft vigors of health; the warm air fanning their faces, flowing over
      the skin with balmy and tonic touch, permeating them and bathing them,
      subtly, with faint, sensuous delight; and the beauty of the world, more
      subtly still, flowing upon them and bathing them in the delight that is of
      the spirit and is personal and holy, that is inexpressible yet
      communicable by the flash of an eye and the dissolving of the veils of the
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      So looked they at each other, the horses bounding beneath them, the spring
      of the world and the spring of their youth astir in their blood, the
      secret of being trembling in their eyes to the brink of disclosure, as if
      about to dispel, with one magic word, all the irks and riddles of
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road curved before them, so that the upper reaches of the canyon could
      be seen, the distant bed of it towering high above their heads. They were
      rounding the curve, leaning toward the inside, gazing before them at the
      swift-growing picture. There was no sound of warning. She heard nothing,
      but even before the horse went down she experienced the feeling that the
      unison of the two leaping animals was broken. She turned her head, and so
      quickly that she saw Comanche fall. It was not a stumble nor a trip. He
      fell as though, abruptly, in midleap, he had died or been struck a
      stunning blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in that moment she remembered Planchette; it seared her brain as a
      lightning-flash of all-embracing memory. Her horse was back on its
      haunches, the weight of her body on the reins; but her head was turned and
      her eyes were on the falling Comanche. He struck the road-bed squarely,
      with his legs loose and lifeless beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all occurred in one of those age-long seconds that embrace an eternity
      of happening. There was a slight but perceptible rebound from the impact
      of Comanche&rsquo;s body with the earth. The violence with which he struck
      forced the air from his great lungs in an audible groan. His momentum
      swept him onward and over the edge. The weight of the rider on his neck
      turned him over head first as he pitched to the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was off her horse, she knew not how, and to the edge. Her lover was
      out of the saddle and clear of Comanche, though held to the animal by his
      right foot, which was caught in the stirrup. The slope was too steep for
      them to come to a stop. Earth and small stones, dislodged by their
      struggles, were rolling down with them and before them in a miniature
      avalanche. She stood very quietly, holding one hand against her heart and
      gazing down. But while she saw the real happening, in her eyes was also
      the vision of her father dealing the spectral blow that had smashed
      Comanche down in mid-leap and sent horse and rider hurtling over the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath horse and man the steep terminated in an up-and-down wall, from
      the base of which, in turn, a second slope ran down to a second wall. A
      third slope terminated in a final wall that based itself on the canyon-bed
      four hundred feet beneath the point where the girl stood and watched. She
      could see Chris vainly kicking his leg to free the foot from the trap of
      the stirrup. Comanche fetched up hard against an outputting point of rock.
      For a fraction of a second his fall was stopped, and in the slight
      interval the man managed to grip hold of a young shoot of manzanita. Lute
      saw him complete the grip with his other hand. Then Comanche&rsquo;s fall began
      again. She saw the stirrup-strap draw taut, then her lover&rsquo;s body and
      arms. The manzanita shoot yielded its roots, and horse and man plunged
      over the edge and out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came into view on the next slope, together and rolling over and over,
      with sometimes the man under and sometimes the horse. Chris no longer
      struggled, and together they dashed over to the third slope. Near the edge
      of the final wall, Comanche lodged on a buttock of stone. He lay quietly,
      and near him, still attached to him by the stirrup, face downward, lay his
      rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only he will lie quietly,&rdquo; Lute breathed aloud, her mind at work on
      the means of rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she saw Comanche begin to struggle again, and clear on her vision, it
      seemed, was the spectral arm of her father clutching the reins and
      dragging the animal over. Comanche floundered across the hummock, the
      inert body following, and together, horse and man, they plunged from
      sight. They did not appear again. They had fetched bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lute looked about her. She stood alone on the world. Her lover was gone.
      There was naught to show of his existence, save the marks of Comanche&rsquo;s
      hoofs on the road and of his body where it had slid over the brink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chris!&rdquo; she called once, and twice; but she called hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the depths, on the windless air, arose only the murmur of bees and
      of running water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chris!&rdquo; she called yet a third time, and sank slowly down in the dust of
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the touch of Dolly&rsquo;s muzzle on her arm, and she leaned her head
      against the mare&rsquo;s neck and waited. She knew not why she waited, nor for
      what, only there seemed nothing else but waiting left for her to do.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
